Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others."

It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.

				"txt": "Isa is a very lovely, sensitive, artistic and gorgeous person. She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana"

				"txt": "The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n"

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day "

				"txt": "This is a ground-level apartment (actually a few steps up from the street) on Rue St. Urbain. It's very spacious and newly renovated. Beds are comfortable and brand-new. Contrary to the description, there is actually a full-size washer and dryer in the apartment.\r\n\r\nTwo bedrooms are near the street and can be noisy when the windows are open. The other 2 bedrooms are in the back and are quieter. You will hear the neighbors upstairs when they walk around, but this was not a problem at night.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is lively and has lots of restaurants. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. Metro stops are a 10-15 minute walk. Parc Jeanne-Mance is a block away and great for an evening picnic.\r\n\r\nFlatbook was very responsive via phone and email (though email sometimes took several hours to be answered)."

Two are tucked away quietly in the back.  Great kitchen, though bring everything you need for cooking.  There are no knives for cutting other than basic perforated bread knives (ie. no chef's knife or paring knife).  The space feels somewhat cold (more like a staged house than a warm home)."

It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals in if wanted.  The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!"

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x"

				"txt": "My husband and I stayed for a week in January; the room and bathroom were warm, very clean, visually appealing, and comfortable.  We met Orestes briefly, as he was out of town most of the time, and he is extremely hospitable and helpful.  Chris, who was around the rest of the time, was also kind and available for any questions.\r\nThe location is convenient to a grocery store, decent diner, and several subway lines; it's pretty simple to get to Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.\r\nFuture guests should be aware that while the guest room itself might be non-smoking, the rest of the house isn't.  Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn't be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\r\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."

The E train and 7 train were about a block away, and there is a 24 hour diner right around the corner!"

It was great to be able to withdraw to the Queens peace and quiet after a long day in Manhattan - and only one subway stop away. Orestes house is located in a historically beautiful street and the room is comfortably furnished with a touch of creative people. Nice bathroom with a shower big enough for two and the sunny garden was beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt was nice to meet Orestes and Cristiàns hospitality, helpfulness and kindness and Kikki, the dog of the house, always greeted us welcome. We felt very welcome and our expectations were fully met. We will certainly return to this place again when we visit New York next time and can only give our warmest recommendations to this place.\r\n"

The bathroom is fantasic....huge!  Great dog named KIKI too.\r\n\r\nThe location is 1 block away from the 7 train.  You can't beat this.  10 min to Grand Central Station and Central Park....15 min to Times Square.  The neighbor hood has many great places to eat.  I highly recommend LIC Cafe which is 1 block away.  \r\n\r\nThis is the ONLY place to stay in NYC!!!"

It was a very cozy place to come back to after long days out exploring New York. The subways are very close. We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb! It was a great and pleasant environment."

The listing description was accurate enough, with respect to the way the apartment looks. If you can't deal with noise at night, however, this might not be the place for you. The neighbors were surprisingly noisy in the wee hours of the night and virtually silent during the day. This apartment is close to the subway, which was very useful."

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros. Una sugerencia sería poner un espejo de cuerpo completo en alguna parte del apartento. En resumen, el apartamento fue perfecto para nosotros, nos volveríamos a quedar y claro que lo recomendaría!

The apartment has all the basic things--it's especially nice to have a kitchen and comfy sofa. There's no TV and wifi, but you probably don't need it anyway since you are here to see New York city! It is just a short 5-min walk from the subway station, so very convenient. Street noise is not a problem although you can hear the neighbors at times (the kids next door can be noisy). East Harlem is a bustling Latino neighborhood with many local eateries and shops. The food selection is supposed to be great (too bad we didn't get to try any). There is a grocery store right outside the building. There're always locals hanging out in front but we were never bothered. All and all, a good choice if you are looking to stay in this part of the city."

				"txt": "We have just returned from a fabulous holiday at Cynthia's condo on Maui. Everything was fantastic. From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia "

Cynthia provides basic amenities, pool towels, bookie boards, snorkeling gear, and the comfort of being in a cozy home.  It was really easy to run up to the Condo for my 9-month old nap times or a quick snack, without being too separated from the family.  The onsite pools, restaurant and of course restaurant/bar became our home bases for the week.  Miso Phat Sushi (across the street) and Maui Brewing were awesome near-by/within walking distance restaurants.  My family and I can't stop bragging about our trip and what a wonderful family/group set-up this Condo is!  We recommend renting a car due to the distance from the airport, but the Condo/Resort has onsite parking."

				"txt": "Such a beautiful location in Paradise! The amazing balconies provided us with gathering spots for our morning coffee to watch the whales and gorgeous sunsets each evening. During our week long stay, we decided to visit Costco, the local fish market and the farmers market and ate 4 dinners in the condo.  The kitchen has everything you need, and the barbques downstairs were perfect for grilling.  Cynthia left us plenty of information for dining in the vicinity, so we had 3 nice dinners out. The guide she sent us before our visit was very informative and helped us to plan our outings while in Maui. Cynthia also checked in with us during our visit, making sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning a return visit to #391 at the Sands of Kahana in the near future!"

We loved that the condo came with some beach gear for our use (snorkels, boogie boards, water shoes...).  The views from the balconies are outstanding.  There is a nice and swimmable beach right downstairs, as well as a volleyball court and a casual restaurant. Great location with easy access to beach rentals, groceries, and anything else you might need during your stay.  Cynthia was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Loved the place!

While climbing nine flights of stairs during an unexpected elevator renovation (that ends in May!) does not sound fun, it was actually not bad at all for the adults in our party, as well as the 3 sub-8 year old children, and allowed us to think we were earning all the delicious calories we ate and drank.\n\nI cannot rave enough about the amenities that are incredibly family friendly, including a full sized high chair, travel crib, toddler (and big kid) friendly toys for both indoors and at the beach. Cynthia is very quick to respond to communication and is clear as to what she can provide as a host, as well as her expectation of guests. She was as incredible as her Kahana home was and we'd highly recommend this place for anyone, including those with small children."

Located on a road with lots of good cheap street food, only ten minutes walk from the main tourist spots of Sultanahmet including the blue mosque and Hagia Sophia. Great road of restaurants just three minutes away with great atmosphere and decent prices - although everyone will try and lure you in! It's a very steep climb up a hill to public transport but not a problem if you enjoy a walk!\n\nApartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Only problem is the noise. The doorbell is loud and people coming in and out kept us awake one night!"

				"txt": "The apartment and the location is good, but the service is not as good as expect. \n\nI have booked a pick-up service from the householder, but there are some problems happened about the plane causing the flight delayed. I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "

La terrazza era molto bella e la vista era apprezzabile. Oltre ai vari letti vi era anche la possibilità di dormire su un divano letto particolarmente comodo. L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. "

Regina had organised someone to meet us on arrival so check in was easy. Check out was easy  llew as we just had to leave the flat at the agreed time. I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place. Thank you Regina!\r\n\r\n"

We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood. "

				"txt": "Cristina and her friend Yamilia did a wonderful job of making us feel at home and were also very helpful with other miscellaneous necessities (calling us a taxi to take us to the airport on departure).  The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs."

				"txt": "麻雀虽小,五脏俱全!很干净也很舒适,感觉有如在自己家似的｡下次如果想尝试在九龍岛住还会想要和 Michelle&May 定香港住宿｡谢谢她的亲切友善与小礼物｡(Hope I'm using the appropriate chinese words!)\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant first experience with Airbnb with Michelle&May. Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"

Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro.

До метро Poble Sec три минуты ходьбы.Для нас оказался необычным подъезд, лестница и правда узкая и высокая, об этом все тут пишут, если есть проблемы со здоровьем, лучше не рисковать. Удачное расположение квартиры позволяет экономить на проезде, до площади Испании и фонтана Монжуик десять минут, до площади Каталонии чуть подальше. Рядом много кафе и магазинов. Из-за рабочего графика Монс, мы видели ее очень редко, поэтому фактически вся квартира была в нашем распоряжении. Это был наш первый опыт с airbnb и он оказался удачным."

Como são os supermercados e as padarias, o que vendem ali ? qual é o dia a dia da população?  Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.\r\nProcuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.\r\nAlém de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora.

				"txt": "Our time in Rio staying at Dejanira's apartment was fantastic, I personally don't think that the photos do the property justice and feel that in person the property is actually bigger! The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again."

It has been nicely renovated and has the comfort you would want. It's spacious for a stay with two people. Most of the interior is new and functions properly. This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.\nA pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.\n\nWe have had contact with Teresa through AirBNB, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!\n\nThank you Teresa and Tim!"

				"txt": "Tyler was very helpful coordinating our arrival with a friend who met us to give us the key and show us to the parking. The parking is a little misrepresented in the current listing, as it is several blocks away and during 90% of our stay, it was occupied by an unauthorized vehicle. We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arise from the parking situation. I'd have given a higher rating had the listing been more specific in this regard or had the situation been resolved more to our satisfaction."

				"txt": "This is my worst Airbnb experience ever!\n\nTyler sent his friend to open the door for us, the apartment is dilapidated and old. When we stepped into the room, it smells like curry or some weird things. We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!\n\nWe already reported this to Airbnb, one warning to the future guest: never trust the pictures!!"

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Airbnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

				"txt": "This modern apartment is located between Sheng Wan MTR & Central MTR. PMQ mall is across the street & visible through the window. Lots of food & drinks nearby, Lan Kwai Fong included (10 min walk). \n\nAlthough conveniently located, it is quiet as party-goers are found wandering in the streets starting one block away. For a straight-shot to the Sheng Wan station, take a couple long flights of stairs. If you have luggage & want to avoid that, use the Central station (or Uber) but keep in mind it is always very crowded there. \n\nApartment was spacious for Hong Kong standards. Shower pressure was strong & stayed hot through long hair washing. Living room has surround sound system & English channels to watch TV. There's an extra closet room for hanging clothes. \n\nOverall, great place to stay as compared to other HK apartments. \n\nAlso note, not all amenities at Dan's place are for communal use. This was not listed under House Rules nor noted anywhere. I was surprised to receive a note after check-out that an already open beverage was not for share although fridge was listed as an amenity. Through dozens of stays on Airbnb, this was my first experience encountering such an issue. Just use caution here."

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n"

The large underground parking is well lit, clean and roomy making manouvering our car very easy. It has direct elevator access to the apartment above, so unloading and loading the car was very convenient.\n\nThe area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.\n"

Nos recibió con comida, vino y muchos otros artefactos que fueron indispensables en nuestra estadía allí (shampoo, pasta de dientes, elementos de limpieza). No solo eso sino que también, se tomó el tiempo para explicarnos los lugares que no nos podíamos perder, y los restaurantes a cuales ir.  Fue un placer para nosotros poder conocerlo, y estamos seguros que en nuestros próximos viajes a Barcelona, contactar a David será nuestra primera opción. \n\nEn fin, nuestra estadía en Barcelona fue asombrosa, y gran parte fue gracias a David.

				"txt": "Booking a holiday at this lovely apartment affords the luxury of two vacations rolled into one -- to easily explore the vibrant city of Barcelona, plus relax and unwind at the beach.  That's reason enough to chose to stay at Centric Boutique at the Beach.  What comes as a bonus is David, a host who takes pride in what he does and who understands that \"goodwill is everything\".  It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES."

It turned out that those reviews didn't do him justice.  From the moment I booked, David made sure to stay in contact with us to ensure that we would be fully prepared for our Barcelona experience.  He even offered to pick us up at the airport!  Upon arrival, David gave us a car tour of the city and took us to some out of the way sights that we would have otherwise missed.  The day before we were leaving, I received a message from David offering to drop us back at the  airport.   He went above and beyond to make sure that our time in Barcelona was as wonderful as possible.  David is the ultimate host and I can't recommend him highly enough."

You can always count on him, in every details. He took care of us before we even arrived. He explained how to get to the apartment in the best way. And he was there when we came. Ready to tell us everything. You can ask him about even unexpected things about your stay and be sure he will find an answer in a very short time. How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret. We are sure! We fell in love with Barcelona, we fell in love with David and we plan to go back as soon as we can. What about next week?"

The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!

The pool has been perfect for our grandson who is turning 4- he can go underwater and still stand up! We’ve all taken the kitchen scraps to the pig and watched him dominate, used the swings, clothesline, and have great praise for the outside bathroom. There is a high minded curatorial process going on here. Everything feels as if it were chosen for a use in this dreamy world of a bygone time. Thank you for making it possible for us to be here for 6 nights. I am so appreciative of your vision, this feeling of old Hawaii.\nSincerely and with Aloha,\nAnna Marie Hamilton"

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

				"txt": "This was my first trip to Hawaii and having used Airbnb successfully before, I was looking forward to our stay! While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n"

				"txt": "This condo is located in Lahaina, close to a swimmable beach and walking distance to a handful or restaurants and shops. Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned. I texted the owner several..."

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host."

There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)"

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier."

Be aware that the access to the waterfront/beach is closed due to construction. \n\nWe had some issues with the cleanness of the house and ended up buying wet Swiffer ourselves and clean the floor and some other kitchen amenities that wasn't fully clean when we arrived. \n\nHot shower was also not working for multiple times, and there are several occasions (at least we know of )that all electricity got shut off (up to 15 min each or so each time), which probably ruined some food in the refrigerator. This might be beyond the owner's control, but something we noticed while we were there.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay in Francesco's place - can't beat the location."

The home has everything you could need... beach chairs, snorkel gear, boogie boards, tons of towels, extra pillows, extra sheets and blankets, pots, pans, coffee maker and much more. Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private. My family loved Maui and we're already planning our trip for 2019 and hoping to stay at Francescos place again! Thanks again for letting us stay at your beautiful Maui home!"

But it meant we made the most of the wonderful harbour beach down the stairs. \nWould highly recommend Beach Escape to large groups. "

				"txt": "We were made to wait almost two hours out the front without any information from the host as to how to get into the house. Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay. If we had..."

Super market is two minutes walking from the apartment. Porto city center is a 15 minute bus ride away. Communication with the host was always fast and clear. We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!"

The condo was exactly as described, the building is right by the water and it's really tidy and well organised. The view is amazing. You get to wake up with the sound of the waves every morning and watch the beautiful Maui sunsets right on the balcony. The process was really simple and stress-free. The place was immaculate. We really felt at home and got everything we needed and more! I'm really grateful for Sherry and Shane's attention to detail and recommendations about the island. Thank you for making this experience better than we could have imagined. I hope we can stay there again soon! "

				"txt": "The view from the Lanai is nothing short of spectacular. It was every bit as advertised. Plus, the proximity of the 3rd floor to the actual ocean means you can hear the waves thoughout the day and night. We literally watched people line the beach in front of our lanai each night to watch the gorgeous sunsets - we didn't need to do that however, we could watch it from the lanai!  We're going to miss that. Folks from the north should be aware that there is no A/C here, which is common in Lahanai apparently, we learned, because of the strong trade winds which cool things considerably. The hosts were very responsive and gracious. This was a very nice experience and we look forward to our next Maui adventure!"

All the things that you would hope there might be but sometimes aren't. The view from the room is perfect. You can hear the waves crashing and the view from the bed is directly into the blue of the ocean. We enjoyed the condo so much there were several days we didn't leave.

The photos you can see on Airbnb are very accurate, though they cannot fully capture the breathtaking reality of staying at this accommodation. In this apartment you will fall asleep and wake up to the sound of the waves of the Pacific ocean. You can enjoy an unobstructed view of the setting sun from the balcony while enjoying your dinner and/or a glass of wine/beer/whatever. You can go for a spontaneous swim in the sea, which is only a few steps away from your room.  Sometimes you can even see sea turtles in the water in front of the condo.\n\nThe apartment is perfectly equipped. You'll find everything you need for cooking, doing your laundry, going to the beach (beach towels, beach bags, a cool bag, beach chairs, etc.) and more.\n\nWe will definitely return to Maui in the near future and we hope that we can stay at Sherry's and Shane's condo again. We strongly recommend staying at their condo!"

				"txt": "My overall experience on Dangar Island was wonderful. Ann created a sense of being cared for, in a relaxed environment. Ann is a wonderful and interesting host with great historical knowledge of the local area. Meal time was fun; some of the food picked from the garden, the rest fresh, delicious and made to suit my individual requirements. Eating breakfast overlooking a pretty garden and watching the river made a pleasurable start to each day. My bed was comfortable and as promised by my host, big soft towels to use in the shared bathroom. The house itself is as interesting as its gracious host and well worth the short ferry ride to visit and stay in for a night or two. Most enjoyable!"

				"txt": "Upon disembarking the adorable wooden ferry on Dangar Island, the charm of the island operates… boat shacks and pontoons line the shore, houses hide away among the luxuriant greenery… We are met by wonderful Ann at the cafe, and while she takes us to the house telling us all about the island, we already feel looked after and start winding down. The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus\" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies. The next day morning brunch was another delicious meal served on the sunny balcony overlooking the vegetation and the river. We left shortly after and felt we could have stayed for a few more days of true pampering!"

Gluten free too for me - very thoughtful indeed. A lovely birthday card too left on the dresser. It's personal touches like this that make for a great stay.\r\n\r\nSo nice to know a bit about the history of where you're staying. Ann does a great talk on the history of the island.\r\n\r\nIf you think you'll need a little sleep in, take earplugs as the local birds get excited in the morning. A wonderful symphony to wake up to, but if you're trying to sleep...  \r\n\r\nDangar Island is just wonderful - we keep coming back.

She could not tell us the wifi password, so we were unable to use the wifi. She told us we could not use the air conditioning.

There is quite a number of restaurants and shops close by and it is only two blocks away to Central Park. Public transportation is within walkable distance too. \nPlease note that you will need to buy some necessities such as trash bags, shampoos and so on as this is not an apartment that someone currently lives in (more of a hotel style with an empty furnished room). Also the streets could be a little loud at night because it faces to Madison Avenue. The service calls were handled promptly. Check in and out were easy. \nOverall I enjoyed my stay at this apartment and would recommend it to anyone who prefers a convenient location but not right into midtown where the traffics are. "

First thing we saw upon entering were cockroaches in the kitchen area - without even having any food around or cooking. This was not properly disclosed before arrival. Although they sent somebody over who laid out baits, the roaches did not disappear. Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently."

Yo mismo vivo en un edificio antiguo.el apartamento estaba limpio excepto por la nevera, que tuvimos que limpiarla a fondo\nCalefacción y aire acondicionado. Muy necesarios los dos porque las temperaturas son un poco extremas.\nWiFi muy bueno, Potente (llegaba hasta la parada del autobús) y muy veloz. Televisión con múltiples canales\nLos quince primeros días estuvimos cuatro personas (mis dos hijos) y estuvimos un poco justos (sofá-cama) pero después una pareja, y perfecto.\nLe vendría bien al apartamento una mano de pintura.\nEs tuvimos mes y medio y NYC es maravilloso, el sitio y el apartamento me encanto, salvo pequeñas cosas, y el anfitrion fue muy amable ya que nos dejó hacer el check out a la 1:00 pm.\nLa comunicación fue siempre por email"

				"txt": "Amazing property.  Could not be happier with this stay.  The house is beautiful, the surrounding front and back outdoor area is very spacious, interior is tastefully decorated, and the ocean is just yards away.  This was a perfect stay for our 2 yr old daughter who had lots of room to run around and absolutely loved the outside trampoline. The location is central to driving to Kihei, Lahaina, Paia or Kahalui. One of the best places my family has stayed.  There are charming ducks and chickens roaming around on the property - the only slight downside was the great amount of duck poop on the porch every morning but it was an easy cleanup with the outside hose.  It was a small thing compared to our wonderful stay. "

				"txt": "Despite the fact that there is not that much in the walking distance (yes, there is a beach and some small stores), this location is a great one as you are in the central position of the island and nothing is more than 20 minutes away. Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.\n"

In addition to the view, we also loved the large yard with lush green grass, beautiful tropical plants & trees, a bunch of large hammocks on the property and a huge trampoline to play with. The ducks and chickens were a fun addition to the property (though they did poop all over the entryway). \n\nUnfortunately, there were some difficulties that were hard to overlook particularly at this price point. The general house cleanliness was quite poor.. floors were super dusty and needed a good mopping. Some of the kitchenware had crusty dust or rust on them. Other things were broken.. kitchen/scissors/blenders/glassware/kitchen gas downdraft. Also, only the living room ac worked, the bedrooms got rather hot. We really weren't expecting these issues at this price point hence the 3* review. \n\nThe house had a lot of geckos. We expected these outside or on the deck- but we spotted these just about everywhere you don't want to see one... in the bathroom, on our towels, on our clothes, on the chair, on the bed."

The location is good- the town is meh (no good restaurants), but you are right in the middle of Kihei and Wailea- both are 15 minutes away.  The kitchen is perfect for cooking and is well stocked.  It says it has a hot tub and it does, but it is attached to the other unit on the property and we felt weird as their outdoor shower is right there.  I was concerned about the other unit on the property as we didn’t rent it, but we never saw anyone (just their car)- and it is a huge property so you don’t even realize it is there.  \n\nHonestly if you are looking for a beautiful home right on the water- this place is more than perfect."

We were only a few blocks from the L train, which is one stop from the city making it pretty convenient - though we ended up cabbing it most of the time. \r\nWilly, the host, was great, very easy to communicate with and everything was super smooth. No complaints. Hope to stay there again sometime. If you are a TV junky, do be aware there isn't one in the apartment, but we spied one in the common area you may be able to take advantage of.\r\nOverall, 5 stars without a doubt!"

				"txt": "I would highly recommend all those reading this review to book this apartment. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r\n\r\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r\n\r\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r\n\r\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r\n\r\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price. "

It was very close to several subway lines and shops, not to mention the river, from which there is such a beautiful view.  \r\n\r\nSecond, the apartment is a lovely alternative to getting a hotel.  While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would very highly recommend staying at Willy's place.  It's comfortable, inexpensive, especially compared to other nearby options, and charming.  We would like to come back soon!"

The apartment is very small: essentially the large, airy and lovely bedroom you see in the photo and then a tiny kitchen and bathroom. But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day. She met the plumber there and dealt with the situation, so it was no trouble at all for us. Definitely recommend."

The location was excellent and Lizzy was so helpful and accommodating (making sure we had some breakfast provisions after we arrived late at night which was so very much appreciated). The apartment was more than spacious enough for our family of 5. The worst thing about this apartment was having to leave those amazing views behind when we left! I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone else and would stay here again."

Tivesse so good I barely went to the gym which is literally minutes away. \n\nCesar was super kind, he is definitely not your regular Airbnb host. As he knows I like to cook potatoes he showed me how to cook Mandioca Brazilian potatoes with shrimps. It was an unforgettable cooking and gastronomic experience. \n\nI will certainly come back again next time I am in Ipanema. "

He provided us with tons of helpful tips about the city, activities, and restaurants. He was easy to communicate with and always available for any questions we had. He definitely made us feel welcome, making us a great little meal when we arrived. \n\nTo top it off, Anna, his maid, made us a traditional Brazilian breakfast in the mornings. \n\nCan’t say enough good things about our experience."

Apartment was larger than I expected, clean, comfortable bed, a/c and fans, wood floors, overall nice vibe and surrounded by Ganesha images. One direction was a few blocks to the beach, another to nice shopping in Leblon or for a jog around the lagoon. I did not need to take taxi anywhere, subway station was a few blocks away and everything I needed was within walking distance. I would highly recommend to a respectful guest looking for tranquility and a quality stay in Rio De Janeiro. "

The apartment was clean and located 3-5 minute walk from Sao Bento Railway station and 10 minute walk to the bus station. It is near all the major sites and a 15 minute walk to The Riberia with restaurants, boat trips and Port caves. \nThe only suggestion would be for the concierge management, in that we were booked for a 15:30 check- in and were left waiting outside until 16:20 on the footpath/sidewalk until Louisa from the management company arrived, I understand traffic can be a problem, but would have appreciated a text or phone call as to the delay. I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.\nWe asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. \nThe door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. \nI would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment.

One thing not mentioned in previous reviews however is the noisy floorboards of the upstairs neighbours. Being wooden and bare (the floorboards) we were hearing (and feeling the vibrations of) the neighbours very clearly and they stayed up till around 2am every night we were there."

My stay was very short as I was heading to the airport, and it's a relatively easy walk to the airport if you don't have too much luggage.

Tea each night, a little light reading from \"Broken Land\" and the comfortable accommodations were the perfect respite after long days of sightseeing. We'd stay there again!"

The apartment really is in the basement, it is pretty dark, you never know what the weather is like until you leave the house, the concrete floors make the apartment uncomfortable (bring slippers), there is no closet to hang-up your clothes and I found the place smaller than it appears on the pictures.

There were hangers for coats etc and a large chest of drawers for other clothes. The place was really well heated. Sylvia & Ty were extremely helpful and gave us an insight into the local happenings. We would definitely stay here again."

It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."

				"txt": "Our stay in New York at this apartment was vastly superior to staying at a hotel.  The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend."

				"txt": "It's hard to imagine a more authentic and enjoyable NYC experience than the one we had staying in this UWS apartment. There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size. Thanks, Chas!"

It's not a huge apartment but the lofted ceilings give it a nice, open feel. Central Park, the subway, a convenience store, a wine store, and Starbucks are all within a block or two. When I first booked the reservation I was unsure about the process to get the keys, but it turns out I had no reason to be worried whatsoever. It was very easy and worked out well.

The apartment was so nice, quiet, comfortable, and cool to come back to after being out and about ( we had a couple of days during our stay where it was very warm ) and that was a plus !

Both Chas and Paul were quick at answering emails and provided us with plenty of information re local grocery shops etc. The pick-up of the keys was also very simple. \r\nThe apartment is in a great location, half a block from Central Park and close to several subway lines. Only up one flight of stairs, which was good because there are no lifts! \r\nThe apartment was very well equipped with everything you need for a stay away from home - bedding, towels, full kitchen etc. It was a bit smaller than it appears in the photos and could do with a lick of paint, but was very clean and had plenty of storage. Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r\nOverall, we had a great time at Chas' apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit New York!

				"txt": "The first thing to note about this apartment is just how impressive it is on first entry. The current photos really do not do it justice. It’s large, filled with sunlight in the day and extremely comfortable. Sophie has decorated it tastefully and with a lot of thought, providing a lovely selection of art and deign oriented coffee table books for you to peruse. \r\n\r\nLocation wise it’s perfect, being a 5 min walk from the Sagrada Familia and there are a number of nice bars and restaurants in the direct vicinity of the apartment. It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its’s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll’s home after a night of eating and drinking. \r\n \r\nSophie herself could not have been more accommodating. She’s was great to communicate with on the lead up to our stay and welcoming on our arrival. We didn’t want for anything on the trip at all. \r\n\r\nIf you book this apartment you will not be disappointed! "

Nice common swimming pool. The neighborhood was even nicer than expected. Right next to the Jardim Botanico, many restaurants in this street and in the Rua Pacheco Leao. The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao. Good starters, great view on the Christ as it is partly an open-air restaurant. Roberta and her sister were very nice for us."

Two things to keep in mind - it's really quite a small space (standard for Rio, but perhaps a surprise for guests who arrive from outside Brazil) and you hear a lot of street noise, so it's perhaps not ideal for light sleepers.

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense."

Несмотря на то, что моя мама не говорит по-английски, Кубилай сумел объяснить ей, где находится хамам и массаж, чем она была очень довольна! Расположение квартиры удобное, добираться до центра легко и недорого с транспортной картой, которую предоставляет Кубилай.

You get your own cabin, so nice privacy. Everything feels like brand new, very clean. Les worked hard to attend my necessities and communication was never an issue. Beware that it's a very rainy place, so I'd recommend bringing your umbrella. Location is not prime, so you will need a car... But I kinda enjoyed being away from all the madness. Overall, you will get your money worth it."

Les' cabin... arriving there after a long day of solo travel in planes and cars I felt like I found a sanctuary. \nThe cabin is very tidy, and everything is new and well maintained. The bed firm and very comfortable, I slept very well the three nights I was there. \nAlthough Rev Les informed me of possible daytime farm equipment noises, I never heard them as I was gone most of the days. The nights were quiet except for occasional rains when windows must be closed, there is a fan that keeps things cool and air circulating. This area of the Big Island is lush and tropical and with that beauty comes an abundance of life, so attention must be taken when preparing or storing any kind of food, as the ants will be quick to make an appearance. Sweet Hawi town is nearby with all its charms, and has a lovely Saturday farmer's market under the shade of a massive banyon tree. The fresh organic farm eggs Rev Les left for me were so appreciated, and the kitchen did provide for all I needed to fry them up for a delicious (Website hidden by Airbnb) were the kind and helpful communications I received from Rev Les. Mahalo for a delightful first stay on the Big Island! c:"

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n"

She was very accommodating our rushed arrival (we had dinner res.!) and had a great printout regarding any questions we might have about her home. \r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed her cat Tsitsou. I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!"

The zone is amazing with all the beautiful stairs which you find at almost every building.\r\nSabrina was very kind and helpful, she answered all my \"important\" questions when she returned home at the evening, gave me some very valuable tips. A rainy day, she left me an umbrella, too!! :)I am sure if I have the opportunity to return to Montreal, I will choose this appartment again :-) Thank you very much again, Sabrina! Cheers ;)"

On arrival I was met at the elevator with a big smile and the key. My surprise when I walked in the door was immense! The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).  I recommend this apartment to you without hesitation. Thanks Nicole! We'll be back!"

From the lounge room as well as both bedrooms and balcony you can clearly see every major sporting venue.

And whilst we didn't actually meet Nicole, her communication was excellent and she was very accommodating when we had a couple of extra guests show up at late notice wanting to stay, and she allowed us to have a late checkout.\r\n\r\nAll of this for a great price.\r\n\r\nThanks Nicole.

The front door also has a screen door which allows for a cross draft with the tradewinds.  The pool and grills are essentially across the driveway.   The grounds are beautifully landscaped.  The complex is extremely quiet.  The location was perfect for walking to Ulua Beach, the shops at Wailea, Wailea Center and Monkey Pod. Tamara and Steve are lightning fast to respond.  Loved staying here."

Paid parking is easy to find just right outside the building and free on the weekend which is a plus. I didn't get to meet Maribel but she was extremely responsive with her communication. On the day of check in, Boris was so kind and he ensured we were able to find the flat and even waited outside the building for us (as the Airbnb direction was incorrect- please be sure to use the address provided by your host). Boris provided suggestions on where to go and places to eat. While there is no washer in the unit, overall a wonderful stay in magical Porto. Btw, there is a really delicious sandwich shop around the neighborhood that serves up cheap but yummy pork sandwiches right by the park. You won't miss it as there's always a long line. "

The complex is absolutely stunning with beautiful well maintained grounds and the pool area and views were absolutely gorgeous. The apartment was clean, well equipped and comfortable.  The only downside was that the bedroom is near the front of the unit and the traffic noise was quite loud, making it difficult to fall asleep. This is probably due to the fact the one of the window fixture in the bedroom is an open blind, offering great air flow but not much in noise reduction. However, this probably wouldn't bother a heavy sleeper or could be easily be minisimed with earplugs. On the whole we would definitely recommend!  "

				"txt": "This was the perfect rental for my husband and I. This is our first AirB&B rental and we were pleasantly surprised! The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended."

That alone would have made staying here worth it, but on top of that, Keneke has stocked the condo chock-full of kitchen supplies and extra beach towels. Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not. I heartily recommend this wonderful clean condo!"

You probably won't find such giant turtles even on most commercial snorkeling tours.

No Wifi in condo but we had our own cellular wifi device. \nOverall it's a great deal and highly recommend this place."

				"txt": "I stayed with my family (husband and daughter) in Patricia' apartment.  We were specifically looking for a quiet place not far from the center.  And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:). "

It is in a fantastic neighborhood in Barcelona, far from tourists and very local but still relatively close to everything we wanted to do. There is a great market right nearby and a lovely square with a few nice cafés and a dynamite charcuteria. The apartment itself is very comfortable, with a nice terrace. Be aware that the lift is up a few steps from the entrance. \n\nPatricia was great to work with as well. We didn't meet her (her boyfriend let us in), but she was ready and happy to accommodate a short-notice extra person who almost joined us there."

We really loved sitting on the terrace in the morning to drink our coffee. The place wad also really clean and it wad nice to have the option of air conditioning or windows open, as it can sometimes be very hot in Barcelona at night. Patricia was very welcoming and offered to order a taxi to pick us up at the airport. I love the neighborhood of Gracia. There are many interesting shops, restaurants and bars, not to mention 4 plaças and 2 great food markets. It is a quick metro ride to the rest of the city, but with a lot to offer in itself! To sum up, a perfectly located place to explore Barcelona! I recommend anyone to stay here."

Two bathrooms felt like luxury (as did the king size bed), and the flat was super convenient to great restaurants (Mamasan and Avila were both tasty in their own ways, and right around the corner) and the beach. Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. \r\n\r\nHaving coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out. We would definitely consider staying here again. "

The bedroom is nice and clean and backyard is awesome. We had a great supper time with A&D in their backyard and we made BBQ! The apartment is located near the water and park is beautiful. The area is quiet and neighborhood is pretty nice. It's 10 mins away from Metro(subway) by feet and we didn't have any hard time traveling around downtown by taking the train. I can't wait to see them again next time!"

We had gone into the city not really knowing what to do, and Denis sat with us for a good 15 minutes describing in detail some of his favorite places and the best times to go. Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!) On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.\nAs for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. Bathroom and bedrooms were clean, and the wifi connection was good. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood with no traffic noise, and there are no pets in case any guests might have allergies. I will definitely be recommending this listing to any friends or family visiting Montreal!"

Has recently installed new shower. Woken up by noisy traffic both days as close to busy road. Honest review . Nice hosts but probably look for something more comfortable next time.

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

Su llavero tenía una tarjeta de descuento para el supermercado, ella nos lo prestó y nos sirvió mucho para hacer las compras. Valeria fue de gran ayuda en todo momento. Previo a llegar se contactó conmigo, también durante la estadía por si necesitábamos algo y previo a nuestra partida. Cuando la contactábamos, teníamos respuesta rápida.

Как оказалось, мои волнения были напрасны: Али замечательный хозяин, подробно ответил на все мои вопросы, объяснил как добраться от аэропорта до квартиры, без проблем встретил меня в 02:00 (я прилетела поздно ночью). Моя комната оказалась маленькой, но уютной с красивым окошком, выходящим в небольшой зеленый сад. Что касается удобств, то здесь достаточно скромно, но есть все необходимое: хорошее соотношение цены и качества. Сама квартира находится в очень хорошем месте: это небольшая спокойная улица всего в 2 минутах ходьбы от улицы Истикляль, где расположено великое множество магазинов, кафе и ресторанов на любой вкус и кошелек. Рядом метро и остановки общественного транспорта. Также неподалеку находится Галатская башня, музеи, рыбный рынок, можно легко добраться до района Фатих (пешком через Галатский мост всего за 15-20 минут). Мои соседи оказались очень приветливыми, дружелюбными и позитивными ребятами, мне было легко и приятно общаться в ними, даже не смотря на мой ужаснейший английский)) Подводя итог, хочу сказать, что моя поездка удалась на все 500%, и выбор данного места сыграл немаловажную роль: здесь можно с головой окунуться в атмосферу удивительного Стамбула, забыть о том, что ты турист и просто наслаждаться этим великолепным городом. Уже задумалась о моей следующей поездке в Стамбул!\nОгромное спасибо, Али! Больше гостей и больше друзей в твоем доме :)"

Here are however the things you should pay attention to: 1 - Whenever you leave the house, please make sure the windows and back door are closed and locked. 2 - The front door can be a bit hard to shut so make sure to give it the extra push or pull so that it locks properly. 3 - There is a washer and dryer downstairs in the basement, which you can access through the living room. The basement light switches are on the pillar, situated at the bottom of the stairs on the left.  Our linen closet is filled with extra blankets and bed sheets. it is in the beige closet at the bottom of the basement stairs. 4 - If you use the microwave at the same time as the toaster or electric kettle, it will blow a fuse so try to remember not to do it. If it happens, no big deal, it can be switched back on through the electric panel in the basement. Voilà ! i",

				"txt": "If I had to describe my stay at Laura's in one word it would be 'AMAZING'! Luckily, I have more space. \r\n\r\nThe room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n"

View of the Christ Redeemer out of one of the bedroom windows. Master bedroom bed very comforatble. Other double room bed rather old and not so comfortble. Aircons noisy in that room too but fan also available. Kitchen well equipped and good washing machine and drying racks. Lounge had good comfortable furniture and large dining table. Wi-fi worked well. Only issue we had was part of the tiling in the kitchen spontaneously cracked and broke leaving the doorway into the kitchen with a very uneven entrance. Host provided a tarpaulin and offered us two free extra nights which made up for the inconvenience, an offer we were able to take up. Communication with host was through (Hidden by Airbnb) ."

				"txt": "Ideal location for the single female traveler!\n\nI didn't even rent a car, took an economical shuttle (Robert's) from the airport and used the city bus (a couple blocks away) to get to other parts of the island. Max $4/day for unlimited bus rides and no parking hassles what-so-ever!  (Read reviews for car rental at OGG and you'll find another great reason for going car-free! Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.\n\nSafeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.\n\nComfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.\n\nEvery appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.  Can't wait to go back!"

My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year."

I never met the named host; I was 'checked in' (their words) by someone else who was clearly in a tearing hurry. Beforehand I was just told I would be met, I didn't know where this would be but I couldn't get into the building and had to wait outside in the street. \r\nThere is no hairdryer or air conditioning (this will make it v hot in the height of summer) and the oven is complicated to work. The design of the building means the apartment overlooks and is overlooked by other apartments and there was some noise at night from neighbours as the units are close together. There is also traffic noise. We were only given one set of keys which was extremely inconvenient. On the plus side the apartment building has a small pool and gym."

Louise was unbelievably  accommodating, allowing us to drop off some things the day before our stay, setting up candles and flowers, leaving us a fruit platter and great provisions for breaky the next morning and responding to a 12am locked out call! She is a gem - thanks again Louise! The French provincial/art deco styled apartment was luxurious with a super comfy bed, relaxed atmosphere and situated 2 mins walk from Queen street's yummy cafes and delis! We would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested, it is worth every cent and we look forward to staying here again!"

My colleague and I stayed there for two nights whilst on business and it was so much nicer that the normal corporate apartment - but still had all the small touches you expect (bath robes, toiletries, hair dryer, etc...). It would also be a perfect place to stay for a pleasure. The location is great - right in the Woollahra village - and close to the city. Louise has exquisite taste and the apartment is decorated with a lot of style and panache.  She was an excellent host who communicated with me swiftly and effectively - our check-in was completely hassle free - and we were welcomed with fresh bread, fruit, and milk. We will definitely look to stay here again and highly recommend it to the airbnb community. "

In addition, the thoughtful food items waiting for us was a pleasure and Louise's communication and consideration for us was really appreciated. It is just so nice to deal with someone that is so well organised and on top of things. Lastly, the location was just great.

Nous y avons séjourné à 6 : les chambres et la pièce principale sont bien, cuisine et salle de bains sont un peu justes pour 6 personnes. Notamment, impossible de prendre un repas à 6 sur cette petite table et difficile de cuisiner (équipement minimal). Ceci dit, il est plus sympa de profiter des restaurants du quartier.\nMathieu nous a bien accueillis et nous a aidé à réserver un taxi pour notre départ.\nAu final, bon séjour à Porto et bon souvenir de l'appartement."

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos."

It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"

Another plus is the proximity of an underground parking garage (15€/day, ask the attendant for coupons). \n\nWe were a family of 4 adults. We found the apartment very well equipped and very spacious. It was clean and everything was in good order. Showers were hot with plenty of pressure. There is a second WC and with 3 women in our group it's a bonus. \n\nCristina was a joy to communicate with and she answered all of our questions very rapidly. She was waiting for us when we got there with a smile even though we were late getting there. \n\nWe hope to return one day to Porto to experience it without the rain and we will be staying at Cristina's place again most certainly.\n\nThank you Cristina for welcoming us!"

The rooms facing the street side are a bit noisy from the street traffic, so if you want a quite room, get the ones facing the garden. There is a washer and a small kitchen upstairs that you can use, and it connects to a terrace. Kamuran welcomed us when we got there and showed us our room. She's usually in the travel agency office downstairs so you can reach her easily if you need anything and get some recommendations on what to do or where to go. Word of advice, don't use their airport transfer car because it's more expensive then just getting a taxi from the airport (taxis run about 50 TL to Sultanahmed and their car transfer is 20$ which is about 72 TL ). We also had to wait 30 minutes outside the airport for the driver to pick us up. "

				"txt": "We booked this room for 5 days because we wanted to split our visit to Istanbul between the Sultanahmet area and the Taksim area. But as soon as we got here, we knew that this is where we wanna be and so extended our stay. The emplacement of this place is just PERFECT. We have walked all over from here, the metro stop is also close. There is a small kitchen and laundry place on the roof, which was great. Also the view is beautiful. ONE small inconvenience would be the morning noises from the street, but that didn't keep us from having a great stay here. I recommend it, and would certainly stay here again if I ever visit Istanbul again!"

The room was very clean we had everything ,even a shower gels and hairdryer, iron,washing machine,we could stuck over food in the fridge that was very useful. During our stay it was very hot in Istanbul so air-conditioning was a life saviour. For all the questions we had about where to go and how to get we got the most detailed explanation,me and my boyfriend couldn't imagine best host then that. All the problems you might possibly have with the room will be solved in a blink of an eye! Location was more then just great, Sultanahmet is the best district to have all the points of interest around you, Hagia Sofia 10min,Blue mosque 7 min ,tram station 8min,lots of place to eat around, only be weary Turkish people(sellers/restaurants) cheat the whole time ,don't order a beer in the restaurant without asking the price ,don't pick up a brush from the shoe cleaning man when he dropped it,in Istanbul is a lot of scam is going on!"

We appreciated the convenience of the dishwasher and washer and dryer.  The grounds themselves are perfectly manicured and have many bbq grills which we used on several occasions.  The grounds are very clean and the bbq grills themselves are cleaned by the apartment complex's maintenance crew.  The grounds are right on the edge of a shore (not exactly a beach that one would go to for swimming and lounging) that provide stunning views of the water and sunset.\r\n\r\nThis apartment is a great value in that you are centrally located among different sights such as Wailea Beach and Lahaina (a 15-30 minute drive).  We would recommend renting a car so that you can drive around the island.  Very few sights would be easily accessible to you otherwise.  There are also a full bathroom for each bedroom, so you have a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment.  The master bedroom has a lanai the provides a good view of the island.  The second bedroom's window looks out into the dark hallway of the apartment floor though.  A free parking spot was provided for the unit, which was convenient for our rental car.  There is also a balcony off of the kitchen that provides you with a great view of the water.\r\n\r\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unit!"

His apartment in Kihei, Maui is beautiful: the location is ideal, the building complex even has a swimming pool and is right at the beach. The apartment itself is spacious, well maintained and gives of a holiday/aloha vibe. Andrew is a generous and flexible host and tried to accommodate wherever possible. We truly enjoyed our experience and stay on the island and I can only recommend his place if you are looking for a fantastic vacation!"

It was very loud for 2 days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the 3rd day. Keep that in mind if you choose to book while the construction continues.

The kitchen, dinning area, and living room have basic furniture that will work for most travelers. The beds are a little stiff but there are worse places to lay your head. The bedroom with the ball lamps on the side table is very bright while the other bedroom is wonderfully dark. Temperature control is challenging since the only AC unit is in the dining area. Water temp fluctuates without adjusting the nozzle/valve, but that's probably building-wide. During our stay there was construction on our balcony so we woke up each morning to those sounds. We were instructed not to open the windows to avoid dust coming in. On the morning of checkout the next client came in at 7 AM. That was awkward. In summary, it's a nice place but this wouldn't be my first choice for the next visit to MTL. "

La casa es maravillosa, se nota que la arreglaron con todo el amor.\r\n\r\nTienes la opción de quedarte en un cuarto privado compartiendo baño como hice yo, o compartir cuarto o tener un cuarto con baño. Cualquiera de las opciones funciona muy bien.\r\n\r\nTiene cocina y un comedor súper acogedor donde pasamos noches conversando, en todos los idiomas posibles. \r\n\r\nLa casa queda en un sector que a mi me gustó mucho, la estación más cercana del metro queda a 15 minutos caminando pero si no quieres caminar hay un bus que te lleva hasta el metro. Quedan cerca supermercados y restaurantes. Está a cuatro estaciones de metro de la playa de Copacabana. \r\n\r\nPara el objetivo que yo tenía funcionó de maravilla, estar todo el día fuera y llegar a dormir a un lugar tranquilo y acogedor.\r\n\r\nLos recomiendo 100%, son amables, divertidos, serviciales. \r\n\r\nConocerlos a ellos y a los otros huéspedes es lo que recordaré con más cariño de mi viaje a Rio!"

Ha estat molt respectuosa amb la nostra intimitat i ens ha obsequiat amb diferents detalls.\r\nL'apartament ocupa la part baixa d'una típica casa \"Brownstone\". Disposa d'un jardinet al darrer ideal per les èpoques de temperatura suau.\r\nLa ubicació és immillorable. Hi ha moltes línies de metro a tocar de l'apartament. En 20-25 minuts s'arriba a Manhattan. Està ubicat a un barri de Brooklyn molt ben situat. L'ambient és molt bo i està ple d'opcions al voltant.\r\nCal tenir en compte que disposa d'una habitació doble per allotjar a dues persones i que la resta s'hauran d'acomodar en un sofà llit i en uns futons a terra en el soterrani de l'habitatge. En el soterrani, sense finestres, s'ubica la sala de màquines, canonades, un traster i un petit bany.\r\nA la penúltima nit hi va haver una inesperada fuita d'aigua al soterrani que Miriam i la seva família van resoldre molt ràpidament.\r\n\r\nHem estat 12 dies a l'apartament i, en general, ha estat molt positiu."

The apartment was perfect for our family of 4 as it was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Miriam was also very flexible in allowing us to have a small celebration for my 40th birthday with friends and family at the apartment.  The apartment proved to be perfect for our gathering because of its amazing location (especially with its proximity to the park, playgrounds, and other local businesses) and its spaciousness and comfort.  We would happily stay at Miriam's apartment on future trips to Brooklyn and strongly recommend it to others.  Thank you Miriam! "

The little things were appreciated-enough hangers in the coat closet to stow our coats, dishwashing detergent under the sink, so we didn't have to buy that at the market. Really nice linens on the beds, plenty of towels, good lighting. Amazing main bathroom shower-we took pictures of it! \nGreat closet space, again with coat hangers. Off of the main bedroom, there is an away space-office type room. My husband used it to meditate, but it'd be great for any kind of quiet space. We didn't use the courtyard, but it would be so nice to utilize in milder weather. \nWe didn't see Miriam, but she was very good at communicating by email. \n"

				"txt": "This is a great little apartment on a quiet tree-lined street about two and a half blocks from the beach.  It is close to everything including the Siqueira Campos Metro stop which is a big plus if you need to get to downtown Rio. There are parts of Copacabana that are quite a trek from the Metro. There are all sorts of restaurants within a block in all directions and of course the beach a 5-minute walk away.\r\n\r\nEverything is brand new and the apartment feels modern and cozy at the same time. It is however quite small. I was there by myself for 4 nights and it was perfect. Great for a couple as well if you get along really well. I wouldn't try to put 3 people in this place. When the bed is unfolded there is very little floor space left. The little space there is actually feels a lot bigger because it is very organized. It is easy to keep tidy since there is really only one place to put each thing. The handy apartment guide shows you where things go, how to unfold the sofa into the various configurations, and has some tips on the area. \r\n\r\nThere is both wired and wireless Internet which was fast and worked perfectly for me. There is a nice little flat screen TV with satellite channels and easily accessible hdmi ports so you can hook up your laptop and play your own content. Sometimes wall-mounted flat screens make it really hard to get to the hdmi ports, but not in this case.\r\n\r\nNote that power outlets in Brazil come in about 4 different flavours and you can never really be sure whether it is 110V or 220V. So bring adapters and make sure anything you plug in won't be fried by being plugged into a 220V outlet. In this apartment all (and there are surprisingly many) the outlets are IEC-906-1 type plugs at 220V. It is 3-pronged but still 2-prong Europlug compatible so if you are coming from most of Europe you won't need adapters. If you are coming from North America, bring some regular US-Euro adapters.\r\n\r\nThe view of Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer statue) is especially nice at sunset and in the evening when it is lit up. There is a shot of it at sunset taken from the window of the apartment here: (Website hidden by Airbnb) \r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine were lightning quick to respond and made the process extremely smooth.\r\n\r\nAll in all this was a perfect and relaxing 4 nights in Copacabana for me."

				"txt": "My rating is 5 out of 5!!!!! This studio is simply amazing!\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine's studio is a beautiful place to stay. The creative design and artistic details are inspiringly put together. It is also wonderful because it is situated in the heart of Copa. Very close to the shops, the beach, the metro, and major tourist attractions. Location and design are the perfect combo to make your stay comfortable and rewarding!\r\n\r\nAlan is such a kind, polite and thoughtful person! I will not forget his kindness. He went above and beyond to make my stay a happy one. In fact, he went well and beyond my expectations of a land lord. He even helped me organise a taxi to leave and booked it for me. Alan also arranged to get the apartment cleaned mid-stay. I did not ask him to do this. In sum, you could not want nicer person to deal with! Alan is a rare gem! He responds to emails in a timely manner and is a generous, helpful and wonderful!  He thinks of everything to make your stay a happy one!\r\n\r\nThe apartment building is nice and the couple that work at the door and look after the cleaning are such warm, kind and beautiful Brazilian people!!! They helped me so much with many things. When I arrived my luggage was missing, so they rang the airport and even offered to drive me to the airport! They even helped me go shopping for electrical goods so I could use my computer. Outstanding kindness!!!  It was a joy to come and home and say hello to them on the way to the elevator. I will miss them very much!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is comfortable because every last detail has been very well considered. Coming from Australia, I found the internet speed very fast and easy to connect. The cable TV is excellent and nice to watch after a long day touring Rio! The kitchen is perfect and is a delightful place to make yummy breakfast etc. The bathroom is very well designed. While the living room and bedroom is a joy to be in due to the artwork and beautiful use of form and light. The use of colour in the studio is visually sophisticated and joyful. I really loved the use of design to create atmosphere and mixed with Brazilian art, this is a real treat to enjoy! Loved it!!!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed dealing with Alan and Catherine. They are perfect hosts and I will be coming back to stay again for sure! Thank you so much Alan and Catherine for letting me stay in your beautiful home. I had the best time and will always remember how lovely your home and your wonderful kindness! \r\n\r\nThank you!!!!!! "

At first may look tight and small, however the decoration work done by the owners are very smart and find for every single free space an appropriate use. The location also could not be better. Just one remark: the street is very peaceful, but Rio de Janeiro is a very noisy place. And the studio is placed between two very busy streets. Finally, Alan,  Catherine (the owners) and Lelita (the maid) are extremely friendly and attentive. The will do whatever they could to help your stay to be the best. "

				"txt": "Alan and Catherine entrusted me with their apartment for a whole month and I would not be too surprised if I were to learn that they had nightmares about this. I am a newcomer to this fantastic forum and had no recommendations or much detail in my profile while the apartment that Alan and Catherine entrusted me with truly is their home in Rio. It is a lovely designed little gem in Copa. It is amazing to see how much thought this couple spent in developing this small apartment into a little home where everything just fits perfectly. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is light during day and the sofa transforms into a most comfortable bed at night. When I read the description of the apartment I initially had my doubts about the sleeper coach but chose this apartment as all other things just sounded perfect. Well, it turned out that the sleeper couch is as perfect as the apartment proved to be. The most comfortable sleeper I have ever experienced!\r\n\r\nThe apartment was recently totally renovated and is kept in such good shape that it still feels new. One of the apartment's big asset (apart from its beautiful furniture and interior) is the large shower! And of course the aircon for the hot Rio summer nights!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is nearby a vast range of fair, good and excellent restaurants and various supermarkets and shops.\r\n\r\nThe special treat is the welcome pack which allows you some time to study the wonderful recommendations and tips Allan and Catherine provide you with in a little info brochure to assist you in finding your own way in the surrounding area. Alan also offed a Kyle chat to assist me finding my way, but I found the info provided so detailed that this was not necessary.\r\n\r\nAs with most apartments in Rio, security is tops with a watchfull 24/7 door guard, who by the way is always keen to help where he can.\r\n\r\nThe Wifi is pleasantly fast and reliable! \r\n\r\nI can only recommend Alan's and Catherine's home in Rio. It is stable for short term, for long term, for business or for just visiting Copa (which, if i may stray off the point :) ) should be on everyones list of things to do while you still can!!!!!)\r\n\r\nThank Alan, thanks Catherine! Your apartment and I will meet gain :) !\r\n\r\n\r\n"

				"txt": "Samba,Sun and  Rio Carnival!\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine were absolutely exceptional hosts who went above and beyond their responsibilities as hosts and we could not recommend them more highly. They were extremely fast in responding to our quires and we had a good few especially as it was over carnival (They even responded to out quires during our week in the apartment and helped us with a problem we were having booking flights to Iguazu falls). The studio is ideally situated in a very safe area (although we found nearly everywhere in Rio to be very safe) that is perfect for exploring Copacabana and the surrounding areas. The city itself can be somewhat overwhelming at first but Alan and Catherine’s starter and information packs gave us the confidence to venture all over they city without hesitation. Carnival is an amazing time to go and it is good to have somewhere private to go back to after a long day or night at a bloc party (which you will run into everywhere). As a first time couple using this site we could not have been more happy with the outcome and it really made our trip to Rio carnival one we will never forget. So all that’s left to say is go and in stay in Alan and Catherine’s beautiful apartment, don’t believe the negative things you hear about Rio and bring a wig or a hat for carnival as you wont see a local without one :)"

Already wary of what I had read about airport taxi, I wondered how we were going to deal with this one.  No problem, everything was promptly arranged with their trusted driver who was at the airport promptly with our name and a reaonsable cost. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is on a beautiful quaint street in the heart of Copacabana.  Building security is fantastic with trusted 24 hr porters,  restricted access to the floors.  We felt much safer than in a hotel -- but Rio  not to be construed as an unsafe city.  We felt fine everywhere we went.  The metro is clean and efficient.  \r\n\r\nEverything in the apartment is well organized and works.  The high speed internet permitted flawless (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at all hours - a great stress reliever when you're on business.\r\n\r\nAlan and Catherine responded immediately to al communications, offered tons of helpful information about the area, checked in frequently to see if anything needed.  Its just goes on and on.  In short, they \"get it\".   Its not about the apartment, rather the total experience. \r\n\r\nPut this on your A list and consider yourself lucky if it books..\r\n\r\nTom and Cecilia Kessler\r\nGuadalajara, Mexico"

				"txt": "We had a wonderful time in Rio! The studio is great! It is very well designed. Everything works perfectly well and Internet is faster than what we have in Switzerland! The location is great too! About 5 minutes walk to the beach of Copacabana, and located in a safe neighborhood. The bus station to go to the Sugar Loaf is about 10 minutes walk and the subway and the supermarket are only 3 minutes walking distance. Ipanema is only a 30 minute walk or you can take the subway (2 stations). Catherine and Alan were very helpful in helping us organize our trip. They were very patient with all our questions and fast in responding emails. They also helped us book our transportation to the apartment and all went very smoothly. We also loved the handbook loaded with all sorts of recommendations. We tried out a few restaurants and were not disappointed. We also went to Churrascaria Carretao (10 minutes walk) as my husband loves grilled meat (very touristy, get there early to avoid the tourist buses!). The hotel Othon has a restaurant on the top floor with a beautiful view of the beach of Copacabana. The food is rather pricey but the view is definitely worth it! The restaurant Colombo in the Fort of Copacabana is supposed to be good too, unfortunately we ran out of time! There are some very nice markets on Sundays. When heading to the hippie market in Ipanema stop at this very small market off Avenida Atlantica just before the Fort of Capacabana! They sell great pastels and the best caldos de cane! There is also an information center on Copacabana only a few minutes  towards Leme... And all this in short walking distance from the studio! \r\nWe highly recommend this place!\r\n"

On top of everything, Catherine and Alan have tastefully decorated the apartment and have quality appointments.  I would definitely love to stay here again, and would highly recommend it to others."

Before I started with the inside of the apartment, like any property the most important is location, location and location. Evan & Maria's apartment is located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. \n\nOkay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. \n\nOn a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we're on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.\n\nAll and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.\n\nThank you Evan & Maria and good luck with the baby ...\n\nyours truly,\n\nThe De Haans"

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos: impeccably clean, modern, updated and cozy.  The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and provided a restful nights sleep after long days exploring the city.  Our adult daughter slept on the futon, and she was in heaven!  There were extra pillows, sheets and a comforter in the closet, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was more comfortable here than in the hotel room we stayed at during our first half of our trip.  The apartment had everything we needed: dishes, Keurig coffee and coffee maker (my #1 priority!), iron, hair dryer and much, much more!  There was a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that I thoroughly enjoyed and a jar full of Hershey's kisses (which we ate entirely too many of)!  Evan and Maria thought of everything; there is even an iPhone charger to use!  For NYC, it was very quiet and peaceful, which came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise to us.  The location can't be beat, close to great restaurants, parks,  & subways.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but let me end by saying that this apartment is so great that I want to live in it!  In fact, our daughter hopes to relocate to the city soon, and she took note of just how well Evan and Maria utilized the space and all the most wonderful details.  Well done.  Bravo!!!"

It is less than 15 minutes to the best beach in the world, Big Beach! A short 25 minute drive to the airport.  the location was also great for our snorkling tour which docked across the street. We only went up the north west side of maui for our luau and parasailing, which the drive is kinda far for that, but not too bad to do twice. Loved the we were able to use the beach chairs and umbrella, THEY ARE A MUST on a sunny day at the beach!!! Only draw back, which is common, was no air conditioning, but we knew that going into it!"

				"txt": "   Marilyn was an excellent host.  She was warm and welcoming in all communication, even texting us during our stay to see if we needed anything.\r\n   I gave her 3 stars for a couple reasons, some out of her control.  Her place is charming, but lacks air conditioning.  I'm from the Central Valley of CA & know heat, but the place is too hot to be in from 12-5pm, even with the drapes closed & the fans on high.  This meant we often could not eat lunch at the apartment & had to eat in town or take something in the morning when we left.\r\n  The upstairs neighbor also has a loud, aggressive, barking dog that we could hear most evenings.  The neighbor also chooses to brush her dog on the balcony, letting the dog hair fall onto Marilyn's patio below, even when we are sitting outside.\r\n  The final reason, most evenings we would return to the smell of pot from neighbors.  Some may not mind this, but it bothers me.  \r\n  I know most of these are not within Marilyn's control, but they did make our stay less than desirable. As mentioned, she was a pleasant host & quickly responded to any questions we had & made us feel welcome in her home.\r\n"

She always got back to me very quickly. \nThe location was great. Everything that we wanted to do and had planned was super close to the condo. The beach across the street is great. Just steps from the condo and never over crowded. The little town just down the road has great restaurants and shops to grab some Souvenirs. We would definitely suggest checking out the Paia fish market for lunch/dinner. You can't go wrong grabbing breakfast at the Kihei Cafe. Make sure to get there early and bring cash!! That's all they accept. \nIf you head in the other direction towards Waliea-Makena you can go to Makena park. Big beach is located here. It's a beautiful beach. The waves get a little big though, so keep that in mind. \nMarilyn's condo had everything we needed. The view is beautiful. The complex is clean and very quiet. We never saw or heard another person the whole week we were there. It felt like we were the only couple in the complex. Our only concern at first was that there is no AC, but after one night, we quickly realized that it was not needed. Marilyn provides multiple fans and Maui gets very cool at night. With the fan and cool breeze, we slept great!! \nWe managed to get around most of the Island while we were in Maui. And honestly, we always found ourselves wanting to go right back to Kiehi! It's a\nVery relaxed and laid back community with not an overwhelming amount of touristy activity, which is exactly what we wanted. \nWe definitely will be back to Maui and would LOVE to stay at Marilyn's condo again!!!!

It is the perfect spot if you want a home-feel/based location.\n\nWe didn't get to meet the host, Marilyn, but she was in constant communication - and followed up quickly on questions.\n\nThe only downsides were:\n1. There is no AC. Coming from San Francisco and being used to the cold, the afternoons in the condo despite multiple fans were almost unbearable indoors. \n2. She had some last minute instructions that we were unprepared for (unlisted on her website) regarding guests/visitors.  She did, however, accommodate our request.\n3. If you love nuts, and nut products, this is not the place for you. We felt a little restricted in the food we could eat/cook at the condo. I myself have multiple food allergies, and most of my food substitutions come in the form of nuts - which I could not eat while there!\n\nOtherwise, you will have a lot of fun, with pretty much everything you need close by, good internet speed, quiet neighborhood, and clean home.

Appartamento con ingresso indipendente, pulito, ben tenuto e con tutto il necessario per 4 persone. I letti sono veramente comodi (non si trovano facilmente nelle case per vacanze). Vicinissimo alla metropolitana, si raggiunge Manhattan in poco tempo, e vicino ad alcuni market, per cui fare la spesa è stato facile. La zona è abbastanza tranquilla, si rientrava anche a sera tardi ma non abbiamo avuto nessun problema. Michelle è una persona molto simpatica, molto disponibile e molto discreta. consiglierei sicuramente di passare una vacanza nel suo appartamento. Grazie ancora Michelle ...e speriamo arrivederci!! I love NY"

				"txt": "This was my first time to use the Airbnb and I'm glad I chose Michelle and her house. \r\nThe house is as it's seen on the pictures. It is pretty good size for three people. My parents slept on the bed and I slept on the couch. I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r\nWhen we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r\nThe location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r\nHonestly, our overall experience was much better than I expected.  Me and my family had a very good time in Michelle's house and NY. If one day I go back to NY, I know where I should stay. \r\n"

				"txt": "Michelle is really nice and her place is very cozy. This was my first airbnb experience and I enjoyed it a lot. Her service is much better than anything you would get at a hotel for a much better price. She gave us a recommendation on where to get breakfast that turned out great. The place is very clean and neatly decorated. It's literally right off the subway station, so that's a huge plus. We also met her mother, who is a fascinating woman. I highly recommend her place, if you are looking to visit the area.  \r\n-- Later Edit:\r\nI should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief. Michelle had the SSID and password printed and ready for guests, so even if you forget to ask, you would still find them in the apartment. Overall, things were very well thought out before hand and Michelle was very proactive with tiny details like this that make all the difference. This was very surprising to me knowing that I'm dealing with an individual and not a company.   "

The apartment is amazing, plenty of room with all the comforts you could ask for (small kitchen/TV with cable/wifi). Easy access to trains and transportation, with many restaurants near by. After this stay, I don't think I'll be booking a traditional hotel in NYC again. Highly recommended!! Thanks again Michelle!"

				"txt": "Nous rentrons d'un séjour de 8 jours à NYC où nous avons séjourn (Website hidden by Airbnb) Adultes et 2 ados) chez Michelle début mars. nous en sommes ravis malgré des températures froides.\r\n==)positifs: \r\nBon compromis rapport qualité / prix. La proximité avec une station de métro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'épicerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extrêmement accueillante et serviable. \r\nl'appartement est simple et très propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \r\n==)négatifs:\r\nbien que situé dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent être difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le métro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais à New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit très calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r\nPour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pièce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes nécessitent d'être pliés  pour installer le 4ième lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les français que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. ça peut être un problème. \r\nPeu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais ça reste un détail.\r\nMais quand on vient à New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Très bon compromis.\r\nLa cours arrière sera appréciable pour les périodes + douces.\r\n\r\nEnglish comments:\r\nJust returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r\n\r\n==)positives:\r\nGood compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r\nthe appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r\n\r\n==)negatives:\r\nAlthough located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as cars & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r\nFor a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r\nVery few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r\nWe really recommend this address.\r\nMany thanks to Michelle.\r\n\r\nPascale et Yann."

Krythia is a really nice lady and we had some great short conversations with her. We felt very welcomed. The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure. Thank you Krythia for the amazing stay in Sydney."

Long story short, the following day I got stuck in the traffic and got locked out from the place I stayed before. \r\n\r\nI was late. \r\n\r\nDellasie was not happy, even I apologized. She won't listen to me explain either, \"don't argue!\" That's what she said\r\n\r\nI didn't see her much during the days I stayed. She did provide me privacy and a big bed. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen sink was always full of dirty dishes, I was not cooking there, just not so pleasant. The neighbour was loud at night, I can hear the TV is on till 2am, but this is New York, which is ok.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is ok, liveable, have privacy, safe area, loads of good restaurants.

There is a big leather couch and a large table full of magazines; I liked the attention to details.  Dellasie is a very sweet and funny hostess (she's also a great singer!). On the bed was a basket with clean towels and a bottle of water. I thought it was a nice gesture.  I didn't see her a lot but she does respond quickly to her emails.

				"txt": "Simply the best for its price among the dozen Airbnb offers in HK I have tried so far. \n\nThe location: very close to MTR station; 7/11 store just down the street (free wifi), a couple of great local restaurants (one offers an awesome 2-person dinner for only 120 HKD, with free wifi), easy access to banks and supermarkets, all within 5-10 minutes walking distance. \n\nThe room: very quiet, clean bedroom and air conditioner (I'm amazed there is no smell at all), comfy living room with kitchen, washing machine (you need that during summer time), and a refrigerator. And you could even find a copy of Animal Farm on the shelf, LOL. This really is what airbnb should offer in the first place, not some small and smelly hostel rooms without a window.\n\nThe host: quick response, easy communication, friendly permanent roommate. \n\nTo summarize: awesome place, would definitely come back and also recommend to friends.\n\n\n\n在香港住过不下十家的Airbnb平价旅店里,Felipe是我目前的最佳选择｡地点便利,步行五至十分钟可达坚尼地城地铁站｡楼下就有7/11便利店(有免费wifi),数家粉面店､茶餐厅(120闷二人晚餐好超值),Watson､百佳､惠康超市｡Felipe的房间安静､干净,空调无味｡起居室有沙发很舒适,附带厨房､洗衣机､冰箱｡书架上还有动物农场和其他一些书,不知可不可以拿来看｡｡｡与房主沟通很好,回复很快｡永久室友(真*房东)也很友善｡总之,远远好过无窗劏房小旅馆｡强烈推荐｡"

With private access it leaves you free to enjoy the environs on your own terms. The beach is a stones through away. I would love to have stayed longer. It is a quiet refreshing space in which to contemplate. A ferry ride to Cronulla is available if one needs to re-quaint once self with urban life, with the addition of train to CBD if needed.

Its just as lovely as in the photos – clean and beautiful and bright and airy and everything there that you could possibly need (even salt and pepper and pasta and tuna…AND scented candles). The place had a lovely vibe and even the bed and the pillows were comfy – and we have a Tempur at home so I’m very picky with beds!  Oh and the artwork is awesome!\r\n\r\nThe garden is lovely too and it’s a short walk to the end of the street to the beach and the national park. The beach is GORGEOUS!! Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend. We’ve already booked our return visit for next month. :-) Thanks Belinda! \r\n"

The house is situated in the district for locals, not for tourists. So you can buy cheap food there. You can find locum for 6 lira/kilo, cheap nuts and other turkish delights.

Next to his place there is a big market (both sides of a long street) with lots of local Turkish food. Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts.

The beds, couch and linen were all clean, fresh and comfortable.\r\nThird, it's only a 10 min walk to Bondi!\r\nFinally, Wayne is lovely and immediately responded to all my questions.  We only booked the apartment a few days before, and it was my first time dealing with airbnb, so we really appreciated the quick responses.  Also, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival which was a lovely surprise!\r\nI would highly recommend this apartment.  It is the perfect place for people who want to hang out, relax and and enjoy one of Sydney's premier beach locations.  \r\nI will definitely go back if I need a place in Sydney. "

It was great sitting on the balcony looking out at the beach and the many energetic people pounding the pavements and in the water enjoying the waves. Wayne and Kate were great hosts emailing and messaging us with directions to their home and suggestions of places to visit. Nothing was too much trouble. The champagne and chocolate they left for us was also well received . We can not wait to return. Thankyou Wayne and Kate for sharing your beautiful home with us."

The bed was comfortable and the decor made you feel instantly at home.  Wifi was excellent and a decent sized TV with Netflix which we didn't use once because there were more exciting things to do.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the apartment block is very quiet ... amazing given how close it is to the main road of restaurants, shops and bars of Bedford Avenue.  \r\n\r\nWe walked around day and night in perfectly safe environment.  We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again."

It’s a plus that you can also wash your dirty clothes and cook your own food!\nPeople in her neighborhood are very warm & friendly, they would smile back when you smile at them.

We were woken up by constant loud noises ( between 12am and 2:30am ) from the tenant family (apparently, who also rent and stay in the house but on a different floor or room). We had no choice but called Derek around 12:16am and later with SMS, but the situation was not under control. The tenant's kids kept speaking loudly and running around, we could not get any sleep between 12-2:30am at all. We felt exhausted and bad in the next morning due to disruptions of night sleep (remember, I also had 13miles race to run).  Definitely, it requires further improvements."

Appeared that host is not the actual home owner but rather part of a management company - not relevant for appartment. Kitchen had all utensils required but no basics such as sugar,salt etc. Good space in the appartment for a group and a great sitting room.

				"txt": "This is a great apartment in an amazing location. The stay is overall very comfortable and I would stay there again. Having said that, there were a few things to note for improvement, but not deal breakers for me: \r\n\r\n1. we stayed a week and ran out of toilet paper on day 3. we were informed that we need to supply our toilet paper. not an expensive buy, but the inconvenience of having to worry about that was not pleasant.\r\n2. the smell of cigarette smoking from other apartments in the building kept coming in through the heating vents, i had to open the windows to air the rooms every few hours. This was certainly unpleasant, but i guess it could happen anywhere.\r\n3. as others mentioned, sometimes smells were noticed in the bathrooms - it happened randomly through the day. i guess the building;s vent systems are not great.\r\n\r\nagain, these were minor things. we felt very comfortable otherwise. we also really appreciated the view and the location. the beds were comfortable too."

Everything was as expected, very clean, very comfortable, nice view from the kitchen window.  Check-in process was fast and smooth.  It is located on a SIXTH floor, but the building has an elevator for 3 people.  Shower cabin in one of the bathrooms is very small, if you are a medium sized man, you will have some troubles.  But anyway, this is one of the few things you have to live with when you travel.  If I return to Barcelona, I would definitely consider this apartment again."

				"txt": "There are no words to describe accurately the experience I had staying with Gabriel and his mum in Astoria for ten days so I will try to be systematic so i can maybe help other travelers.\r\nFirstly the room was amazing. It was the basement of their home with a lot of space and a half bathroom. Really relaxing experience with all the privacy you want, a large TV with Netflix and Amazon  for those who like to watch a nice movie when coming back from a long day in New York. The photos on airbnb are not really capturing how nicely decorated and well kept is the room. Nothing compared to other rooms I have seen in Astoria. The towels provided are of very good quality and very large, the wi-fi works perfectly and there is plenty of space for your things. To me and after seeing a lot of rooms, there is no doubt that this one is the best taking into consideration the space provided, the location and the price asked!\r\nThe neighborhood was again really pretty. Very safe with lots of shops for food and interesting markets. I had the feeling and really wanted to go back to Astoria and walk around after a busy day in Manhattan. 4min walk to 30th station and 16 min ride to Lex avenue and the upper east side which in my opinion is the best area in NY \r\nI can't say enough about Gabe and his mum. Their hospitality was awesome! I was welcomed with a lot of snacks, fruits and a bottle of wine waiting for me when I arrived and kept coming during my stay. Gabe was answering immediately to all my texts and tried to sort out anything I needed in order to feel more at home! But besides that the most important thing is that both of them are very interesting and well educated people. You can have a lot of discussions about lots of things and learn, which at least for me is very important! I think I made some friends in NYC, which by the way is a truly amazing city.\r\nHighly recommended, no need to look anywhere else! Thanks a lot guys."

He had answers to my questions about the area and was good company while I settled in, great guy.\r\n\r\nHis guest floor includes a private entrance and bath, custom furniture laid out to fit the space, and enough artwork to befit a museum.\r\n\r\nLet me count the ways I loved this place:\r\n1) Laid out and available were snacks, coffee machine + spindle of flavor cups, water, and a toothbrush.\r\n2) The place has style. I keep a good home but Gabe clearly has a future career as interior decorator awaiting him.\r\n3) Plants! There's a garden of greenery spread around the apt.\r\n4) Everything useful is labeled, from the lightswitches to the recycling bin.\r\n5) There is a pre-sentient voice-activated music player in the living room. \"Alexa play some Jazz\". \"Alexa louder\". \"Alexa next\". I'll be getting one of these for myself, it's from Amazon apparently.\r\n\r\nHosts like Gabe make Airbnb amazing to use. I hope all my future hosts will be similarly excellent.\r\n"

The room is better than as advertised and has all of the necessary amenities. The apartment is a short two minute walk to the nearest metro, and about a half hour train into Manhattan.

The area is perfect, very close to the train, shops, cafés and some of the best food on this trip. Super nice block - nothing to worry about with a private entrance, that allows you to come and go freely. It was such a nice spot! The pictures do not give you what the experience will - it was great not having to NOT worry about anything.  \r\n\r\nGabe provided towels, toiletries, iron, Tylenol any and everything you may need on a trip (that you sometimes forget to pack). Thanks Gabe!\r\n\r\nI totally recommend staying here, whether for a day or a month. The price is right and the place is even better :)"

Probably one of the best Airbnb options in Astoria and definitely way better (in terms of value for money) than any hotel, especially if you are staying for more than a few days.  \r\n\r\nBottom line - was very happy there and would stay again or reccommend to friends."

The place is cosy, clean (for long time visitors: the cleaner comes once a week), and the location could not be better (5 minutes walk to the beach, restaurants, shops, Stanley market; half an hour by public bus to central Hong Kong).\r\n\r\nMarcos is a very nice and helpful person. He answered all our questions quickly both before and during our stay. He even came up with a few beach toys for our children and offered them participating in a tennis lesson for kids free of charge.\r\n\r\nPerfect appartment offering value for money, perfect host, perfect stay - thanks!"

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. "

Communication from the very start was fast and detailed. Every question was answered, and our request to start our trip a little early was accommodated without any fuss. He also sent us a PDF guide with lots of pages on tips for restaurants, beaches, snorkeling, driving adventures etc. A lot of them we followed.\n\nThe apartment itself is exactly as advertised. Comfortable, well equipped with all the essential kitchen appliances and accessories. Air conditioning in the main living room, and portable air conditioning in the bedroom which worked a treat during our stay. The added extras such as beach chairs, beach mats and a drinks/food cooler was very much appreciated, and used every day. Parking is right at the front and easy to access. \n\nThe location is to die for. Having explored every part of this amazing Island we agreed that our favourite location was Kikei. The locals were very friendly, access to restaurants and supermarkets was just minutes away, and many of the Island learn to surf clinics (highly recommend doing this!) were run from a beach 5 minutes walk along the street. Every day we swam with turtles at the beaches immediately in the area of the apartment. You can literally walk out of the apartment, across the road and watch the sunset over the ocean every day. Amazing!\n\nI highly recommend this apartment and Thomas as a host."

Check in was seamless and he had 2 bottles of water for my husband and I in the fridge. He also laid out some snacks and candies for us, and had coffee and tea for us. We thought it was very kind of him to do that. The only con was that the air conditioner is in the bedroom closet, and when the closet door is closed it’s okay. But when you open the closet door to let that cool air into the room, the AC is loud. So this made it a bit difficult to sleep through at night. We were also bummed we never got to meet our host and we called him to inform him we were checking out and he never got back to us. Other than that he was communicative throughout our stay and we enjoyed our trip to Maui. :)"

I have no cockroaches etc and ask that drains remain covered to ensure my home remains this way. 2. Walter filter. Water is drinkable from the tap. If you choose to use the filter - please ensure it is only filtered with COLD water. The hot water ruins the filter. 3. Hot water: please leave OFF when not in use - prevents high power costs. It is electric so it'll need 3-5 minutes to hear prior to a shower  4: When going out for the day, or leaving, please ensure the following is turned off: water heater, air-conditioners, lights & coffee machine. (& sink holes closed/covered) 5. When leaving, please ensure the door is locked (seems crazy, but many forget this!)",

It was her first trip to the U.S. and she wanted to see New York, a real, authentic, and old New York. Bushwick is that right now. It's hip, arty, and with just enough grit to make it feel like you're in New York not the theme park that tourists end up going to. Her apartment is close to trains, some great restaurants and grocery stores, and the building is really cool. We mostly stayed out, but when we stayed in we could cook and watch Netflix like we were home. I can not stress how comfy she has made it. I really felt like I was home. I would highly recommend Shannon's place and would love to stay there again"

				"txt": "For our first time in New York, it was somewhat courageous of us to live like locals, deep in the neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn.  It took some adjusting for us to hang out in the area.  The area is considered 'gritty' which is extremely true. I cant stress that enough. It is dirty, you might be bothered for spare change, you might be asked to swipe your metro card for someone,  however the area does have some of the coolest restaurants in the city. But you must go looking for them, otherwise you will only find corner deli's that don't take international credit cards and random pawn shops etc.  We actually loved our experience at Shannon's though. Shannon's studio was great. Lots of space for two. The only complaints we had were that the walls were paper thin and it was all around a bit dirty. We washed the dishes before using them since they were dusty and just kept a fan at night to block out noise. We also could not reach Shannon until the day of our reservation and had to wait past check in time to get the keys. Once we were in contact, Shannon was super nice and helpful. The roof top is amazing! You can see some of Manhatten's skyline. The subway takes about half an hour to get to Manhatten , once you are there, probably another 15 to wherever you want to go. It is nice to get away from the zoo of Manhatten, I strongly recommend staying in Brooklyn, it's gives you more of a well rounded experience.  For us, this was great, we loved the experience of what it would be like to live there."

Brooklyn, however is a neighborhood that is being transformed. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Manhattan, but worth staying in Brooklyn and explore this part of the city. Shannon's attention was good although not met, although slow to respond to messages so you have to take that into account. The apartment was clean, but the building was not.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it is a good option to stay especially if you're a tourist and you want concoer both Manhattan and Brooklyn."

It is very unique, peaceful, serene, excellent for relaxing and meditation. The gingerbread is close to a cool little beach town called Paia and the Baldwin Beach Park. Thank you for letting us enjoy your beautiful property. We definitely recommend the Gingerbread House for couples!\nP.S. Don't bring an alarm clock, the roosters will be happy to wake you up in the morning!  "

The grounds offer a variety of fruit trees and it is set in tropical rain forest.  It was a most pleasurable base for our adventures on Maui."

The seasonal creek behind the house was flowing, the tangerines were juicy and ripe, and the succulent garden was spectacular! Eve has really created a special place with her creativity and green thumb! The labyrinths arranged on the property were fantastic for clearing the mind so we even bought a book Eve wrote about labyrinths. Thanks for the beautiful accommodations! Bodhi the dog is super chilled out and cool to have around too. Very private but not overly isolated. Perfect place!"

				"txt": "This was a wonderful experience! It was also our first time using Airbnb and visiting a Hawaiian Island and we would definitely do it all over again. Early in our planning we intentionally made the decision to avoid the big resorts and seek out something that felt a little more like the \"real\" Hawaii. Eve's rustic cabin provided just that. The cabin was clean and comfy, with a great amount of lighting and windows. One of my favorite parts of the cabin was the large window high above the kitchen that looks into the jungle across the stream. It almost looks like a framed painting every morning when you wakeup.  The chirping birds in the jungle made it that much better. The property is close to Makawao and Pa'ia, both of which have great dinning and shopping and a great small town feel. We still visited the big resort towns for the beaches which weren't too far away. A baby beach protected by a reef is also just 10 min away! We found the cabin to be a great central location to see just about everything on the island. \n\nTip: We bought the book \"Maui Revealed\" before we made this trip and used it religiously the entire time we were there. Kula Bistro is a must, Makawao fresh morning doughnuts in the white building with green trim and usually a line (it's quick I promise!) 808 Cafe has great food and is across the street from our favorite beaches. Drive to Hana takes all day if you go all the way around, but is so very worth it. Get out and see everything! Bring food!\nThe Gingerbread Cottage is a perfect central location to everything on the island, but far enough from the hustle of the towns. Be sure to do the labyrinth walks on the property, it's a great way to prepare your mind to enjoy your vacation, also go sit by the river and read a bit, it's very relaxing. We will be back next year!!!"

				"txt": "Jim's place was a very comfortable and relaxing place to stay in Wailea. Our family of 8 stayed comfortably in this condo, with the use of the fold out lounge, which was very comfortable. It was great to have access to beach umbrella's, chairs, boogie boards, snorkelling equipment, beach towels etc. when visiting from overseas. We were able to make the most of the beautiful beach in Wailea. We were able to park both of our hire cars right at the front door of the condo, which made getting around Maui so much easier. The condo is in a great location, only a 3 minute drive to the beach and a stroll to some great restaurants and shops. There is a supermarket 10 minutes up the road which was good to be able to make use of the fully equipped kitchen. The washing machine and dryer were a bonus. Jim was extremely efficient with all communications prior to and during our stay and made the entire trip a breeze. I would recommend this place for families wanting a relaxing holiday. "

You get a lot for you money, big apartment with tall ceilings, very tastefully (and newly) decorated and with a huge terrace which was nice but I hardly used it as I was out so much. \n\nThe host was very friendly and communicative. In terms of location it's within a stone's throw from the main shopping and nightlife of Taksim but enough out the way that it won't disturb your sleep. Restaurants, cash machines etc are all less than a five minute walk. It's barely a minute from the main road so you're not walking deep into a potentially dodgy neighbourhood. Do your (Hidden by Airbnb) maps homework before you get there and it's easy enough to find. \n\nI took the Havatas bus from Attaturk Airport which took around 50 mins and dropped me off in Taksim (Point hotel). From there it was about a 15/20 minute walk. If you come with suitcases however you'll want to get a cab as the pavements in Istanbul are not build for cases! Next time I'm in Istanbul I'll definitely be coming back here. "

We heard some news of some areas being dangerous, but never felt a bit in danger ourselves and we traveled all throughout the city. We will stay here again and again every chance we get to return! Thank you so much Julie and Faruk, you are amazing! "

His friend even helped us take our luggage’s to a new apartment that was 5-10 minute walk. \n\nThe reason why I give this a three star is because it was not as advertised. The number of bedrooms, bathroom, and pictures did not match. Also, they were queens size beds and not king. \n2 bedroom had 1 Queen bed \n1 bedroom had 1 Queens and 1 twin bed \nAnd rest were sofa beds. \n\nAnd one full bathroom and 1 was half bathroom (only toilet and sink) \n \nAnother reason I give this place a three star was the fact it was cleaned only once in our entire 1 week stay. \n\n\nOther than that this place was great."

Tout d’abord, la rua do Almada, où elle se trouve, est une rue passionnante. Des boutiques vintage ou design, sont à côté d’autres endroits qui vendent des produits électriques pour artisans comme nous n’en voyons plus à Paris. Nous avons été si bien accueillis par Alexandra qui s’occupe de la maison. Elle parle un français parfait et l’anglais aussi. Elle nous a donné plein de bonnes informations pour profiter de Porto. La maison, elle-même est magnifique. Elle vient juste d’être rénovée. Nous avons adoré la pierre que la propriétaire a sauvegardée sous les fenêtres et autour des portes et les volets typiques à l’intérieur. La décoration est très soignée. Là aussi, un mix d’objets très design, comme la superbe lampe dans la cuisine ou dans le salon et des petits meubles vintage un peu partout, très beaux. La cuisine est un bonheur. On pouvait prendre notre petit déjeuner sur la terrasse qui donne sur un petit jardin adorable où l’on peut descendre par un large escalier. Nous avions un grand choix de vaisselle magnifique. Les chambres sont aussi très confortables. Chacune avait sa salle de bains. Mais le must, c’est les draps. Nous avons eu l’impression de dormir dans un hôtel 5 étoiles. Douillets et soyeux à souhait. J’aimerais avoir les mêmes chez moi ! La bibliothèque du salon contient plein de livres intéressants et une bonne collection de dvd. On s’est senti chez nous, avec un certain luxe en plus ! C’est sûr, nous reviendrons à Porto et dans cette maison qui nous a touchés. Le séjour était trop court, comme toujours…"

The neighborhood is truly in the fashion of a Bohemian San Francisco with steep winding streets and many excellent restaurants, flea markets,and designer shops all near by.\r\nThe best surprise of all was the the fantastic roof patio where one can sit and see the beautiful views of the Golden Horn and the Blue Mosque in the distance.\r\nThe rooms are airy and light with tall ceilings, and her personally designed cabinets and interior ,had such a simple elegant feel.\r\nThe separate bedroom is extremely cool in the summer and relaxing ,which has a view to the back over a tree covered 400 year old Hamam .The combined call to prayer and  the sound of many birds is positively magic. \r\nI highly recommend this Flat\r\nMichael Schmitt \r\nSanta Barbara California "

The only drawbacks for us was the lack of kitchen staples (most rental homes include ample sugar, salt, olive oil bottles, etc) and some issues with electricity (the only way to turn on bedroom lights was via turning on the living room light as well and there was lacking useable sockets in the bedrooms). Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely return with larger groups again."

			"about": "Olá,\r\n\r\nEstou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas. Recomendo muito!” - Bruna Ferrary Deniz (Brasil)\r\n“The apartment was better than we could have imagined. The photos don't do it justice. The place is huge, in a great location. Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host. Friendly and extremely helpful”.- Soren (Denmark)\r\n “It is really difficult for me to put down in words how grateful I am to Fabio! He is a wonderful host and a GREAT person!”- Justine (Dubai)\r\n“Más que anfitriones, hicimos una linda amistad. Gracias por todo... “- Leo y Aura (Colombia)\r\n“Fabio is a very friendly and considerate person and clearly takes great care of the apartment”.- Jonathan (Spain)\r\n“New to Rio? You should definitely speak to these guys.”- Vitaly (Russia)\r\n “Fabio is an amazing host with a deep concern for his guests' comfort. We feel that we now have a good friend in Rio!”- Ali (Canada)\r\n",

The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

I walked to Mrs McQuarries point one day and it took just over an hour to do so, buses take 10-15 minutes to central. Paddington itself is a cute neighbourhood with some nice places to eat/drink/shop nearby. Quite a few steps to take up to the flat just for anyone who might have issues with that, I didn't. Really enjoyed my stay at Jessica's flat highly recommend it! "

Take the famous Central-Midlevels Escalator on the way home and experience the hustle and bustle of Soho.  Or take the ferries from Central to other parts of HK. Plenty of artisan coffee, local cheap eats, restaurants, and bars just a few steps outside the apartment. The place was very clean, had great storage and all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. Audrey was very responsive and even suggested some amazing eats. Her roommate, Stella, was just as friendly and welcoming. I had an amazing time in HK thanks to Audrey and Stella. Will definitely revisit when I'm back in HK."

				"txt": "My parents came for their first visit (in a decade) to New York, so I booked Judy's second-floor apartment, just down the block from my flat. They spent a long weekend (three nights) in this spacious airy apartment.  The accommodations are clean, comfortable, secure, and include a well-equipped modern kitchen.   Judy was very nice and welcoming, providing a supply of breakfast staples as well as great hints about neighborhood cafes and restaurants.  My mother - always apprehensive about parking - was especially pleased that there is lots of free on-street parking available in the surrounding neighborhood.  Judy was easy to correspond with in advance and to connect with the day they arrived - she's very responsive, and even let me preview the space to ensure it would be accessible for my older parents. I hope the apartment is available the next time they visit Brooklyn - which they are excited to do as a result of a very restful, comfortable weekend."

The apartment was very spacious and immaculate.  There were fresh cut flowers on the table and a few essentials in the kitchen: milk, cereal, coffee, tea bags, etc.  These nice little touches were very much appreciated!  We had a quick breakfast at the apartment and then were on our way and ready to explore.  There were also toiletries (shower gel/shampoo) in the bathroom for those (like my son! who do not bring their own!  Judy also had an extra bedroom just down the hall that I rented as well (for privacy).  The apartment is located in a very nice and charming area with lots of (inexpensive) restaurants nearby along with some cute shops.  You can walk down Atlantic Avenue or State to get to Brooklyn Bridge Park (which is quite lovely!).  It's about a 10 minute walk.  We were literally a 3 minute walk to the nearest subway heading into Manhattan, so that was a plus.  Staying in Brooklyn is the way to go if you like a less chaotic and quieter place to stay.  We will definitely be back!"

Just a couple of blocks down Bond are two more very good restaurants, Building on Bond and Ruccola. The neighborhood is great to walk around. Smith St. is just a couple of blocks away with tons of shops, bars, restaurants.

Although the nearby avenue can be a bit loud at night, earplugs are provided, and the cool humming of the aircon happens to cover most of it.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is great ! Lively yet very safe. Within walking distance is the buzzing Fulton Mall, and the more elegant Smith St. and Court St. Plenty of restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés. Judy and Sasha provided us with a list of their favorite places - Don't miss Van Leeuwen's unforgettable organic Ginger Ice Cream ! Catch the A and C lines at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, one block away, and ride to downtown Manhattan in ten minutes... \r\n\r\nJudy and Sasha are discreet hosts, yet very caring.

Le quartier regorge de restos, cafés, bars et boulangeries. Sasha et Judy fournissent une liste de leurs endroits préférés. A un pâté de maison, vous trouverez les lignes A et C à la station Hoyt Schermerhorn, qui vous emmène dans le Sud de Manhattan en dix minutes...\r\nJudy et Sasha sont des hôtes discrets et prévenants.

It is also worth mentioning that the apartment is within walking distance to the bustling Fulton Mall stretch, where you can find good buys.\r\n\r\nI found the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station to be very convenient as it was very close to the apartment. You can catch both the A and C lines which will take you in and out of Manhattan in about 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nJudy was a joy to deal with and I thank her for her hospitality.

He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. \nOnly downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "

Er hat uns vom Flughafen zu unserer Unterkunft und wieder zurück zum Flughafen mit seinem Auto gebracht und zwar gratis. Er wollte einfach nichts von uns nehmen. Für die Stadteroberung haben wir ebenso gratis zwei Fahrräder bekommen. \r\nDie Wohnung befindet sich in einer sehr guten Lage, bis zum Strand braucht man weniger als 15 min. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet mit einem Balkon mit tollem Ausblick über die Stadt. Der Gastgeber war fast nie in der Wohnung und wenn er kurz da ist war er sehr hilfreich und hat uns insider Tipps gegeben. Zum Schlafen hat er ein eigenes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad und WC, somit komplett getrennt von uns. Ganz ehrlich kann ich diese Unterkunft jedem empfehlen und ich hoffe wir werden wieder mal Froilans Gäste sein :)"

The location of the place is spectacular, the view is amazing (nestled inbetween so many skyscrapers) and getting in and out of the place is really easy! We had a bit of trouble checking-in, since we didn't have the apartment number in the information provided to us. That was not Tara's fault though.. When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing. But there is a window in the shower, so it's very easy to just air-out the bathroom with the door closed!\nOver all we are very very happy with our stay at Tara's place and would definitely come again:)"

We felt safe and cozy, and the building was quiet at night for restful sleep. Tara was very easy to get in touch with and provided responses quickly. I loved the location—super walkable to great restaurants, the zoo, Victoria Peak, and lots of public transit—but beware, if it is your first time to HK island and you want to walk from the subway/ferry, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps won’t show you the amazing escalators and walkways that will make getting there a breeze, and you might get stuck carting luggage up many flights of stairs (as we did). I highly recommend staying here if you want to experience HK island like a local. Just remember to research the walking path, or take an alternate form of transportation if you’ve got heavy luggage!"

They have awesome recommendations on local places (including places with local deals) and the room does not let your expectations down. The view is absolutely amazing, no matter the weather. The room and amenities are very clean, with extra towels and sheets in the cupboard, should you need them. I was worried about heating since it's winter and the listing didn't have heating ticked, but they provided a thermostat heater that kept us nice and cosy. Another cute thing to note was the deco. There's an adorable kiwi bird toy and some binoculars that we took advantage of with the great view from the window. Also, go up to the terrace! You definitely won't be disappointed at Maria's :)"

Also perfect, if you arrive by car - free parking just in front. 15 mins walk to downtown but lot of cheap cafes and restaurants full of locals around.\nThe check-in was perfect. We got lots of information, what to do/see/where to eat. Thanks for that. \nThe Apartement is very small but for a short city visit, big enough. If you stay for a week or so, I would recommend a larger Apartement.  "

Elle connait Istanbul comme sa poche. La chambre est au dernier étage, elle est calme et douce.

Eine unglaublich sympathische und unterhaltsame Dame, die ich sehr schnell ins Herz geschlossen habe. Sonntags sind wir zusammen zum Bio Bazar gelaufen und an einigen Tagen kochen wir sogar was zusammen.  Mein Zimmer befindet sich im obersten Stock, wo ich komplett meine Ruhe habe. gegenüber von meinem Zimmer ist eine wunderschöne Terasse, die zum Yoga machen oder ein Buch lesen einlädt. Gäste sind auch immer willkommen. Fatma hat ihre eigenen Stil, welches dem ganzen Haus, bis auf den Eingangsbereich, einen unglaublichen charm gibt. Jedes Zimmer ist individuell und man muss sagen, dass bis her die Leute, die ich im Haus kennengelernt habe, echt toll sind. Wenn man sich für Fatma entscheidet, sollte man auf alle Fälle kulturoffen sein und sich diesem schönen antiken Stil und der Nostalgie einfach fallen lassen. Ich bin durch Fatma und durch die Wohnung in einem alten Istanbul angekommen und fühle mich super wohl. Zu meiner Arbeit in Cihangir laufe ich täglich zu Fuß. Die Lage ist sehr perfekt. Ich brauche kaum Bus oder Bahn zu benutzen, da ich alles in Beyoglu und Taksim finde, was ich brauche. Nur für meine Touristentour habe ich lediglich die Bahn benutzt. Obwohl man zum Eminönu auch zu Fuß laufen kann, wenn man spazieren gehen mag. Ich danke Dir, Fatma abla, so wie ich dich gerne zu nennen pflege, für Deine Offenheit und Deine Wärme. Ich werde Dich sehr bald wieder besuchen kommen und hoffentlich sogar mein altes Zimmer beziehen im obersten Stock. "

The location is wonderful: it's easy to get anywhere by foot, taxi, bus, dolmus, metro or boat.\nFatma, who lives there, and her daughter Elvan, who lives in Italy but is quick to communicate by email, are extremely friendly and helpful. \nFatma also cooks wonderfully and even offers cooking classes. \nI would definitely recommend staying there, for three nights or three months, and hope to stay there again myself.\nBe aware though that if you have respiratory issues, this might not be a good choice as there is a fair amount of smoking happening inside, and even the neighbourhood is quite smoky because of the coal heating."

If you stay here you will meet many interesting people from Turkey and around the world passing through the house. The area will not be to every ones tastes, but I highly recommend it for the more adventurous among you."

				"txt": "Fatma and Hasan, the hosts, are truly some of the nicest people I've had the chance to come across. I stayed for 3 months and loved every second of it, only regretting that I could not stay for another three. The landlords are fantastic and experienced Airbnb hosts, which makes the experienced that much better. Fatma is an outstanding cook, and one should not miss a chance to dine with her and Hasan! The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites. Would recommend without any hesitation, as I already did to two friends of mine who also stayed at Fatma and Hasan's house. "

				"txt": "I spent a really nice month at Fatma's house. The room is lovely and fits the description. I also really enjoyed the beautiful terrasse from where you can watch the neighborhood. I thought the house was in an ideal location to explore the city. The street where the house is on is pretty calm. \r\nThis room is on the same floor with the terrasse and the kitchen, so you have ideal access to both of them. The kitchen is ideal if you just want to cook something small from time to time as there's only one cooking plate.\r\nThis room is perfect for people that wish to be in contact with the host and exchange with them from time to time as you walk by their living room and kitchen as well as share the bathroom with them. If you rather be a little more to your own and mind cigarette smoke, I recommend one of the other rooms.\r\nFatma and Hasan are both very very nice, always asked about my day and they were very patient when I tried to say something in turkish. I hope that my turkish will be better one day so that we can have longer and deeper conversations!  They made me feel very welcomed and I also really enjoyed meeting Fatma's daughter and grandson!They are very generous, sometimes invited me for tea or something to eat. I also got lucky to taste some of Fatma's amazing food! "

The bathroom of which you can´t see picture was aesthtic too.\r\nParticularly if you are in Istanbul because of learning Turkish Fatma and Hasan´s house will be the best choice as both are very communicative and patiant with beginners. Above all Fatma and Hasan are such nice people, I am really looking forward to stay in contact with them. \r\nI highly recommend the room. But you should have no problem with shareing the bathroom with the hosts as well as shareing the kitchen and the terasse with a lot of other guests who stay in the house. But that´s why the attic room is the best one for people who want interact with the hosts and get to know other guests.\r\nI also loved the neighbourhood.\r\n"

I was alone with Hasan for the most part as Fatma was out of town. During that time he always made sure I'd get home safe at night. I thought that was very endearing. The room itself is super cute, with its own kitchen and terrace access, which I tremendously enjoyed as it gave me the sense of having an entire apartment. The neighbourhood is a bit off the tourist track but for that reason very charming. And it still is very close to Istiqlal, essentially just across the street. So you are strategically located. "

Building is more modern than most in the area, with a doorman and elevator. Apartment has an open view (not easy to come by on HK island!) Carmen keeps her place tidy and well equipped with everything you need. Bed is short (as others have noted) and the sofa is small too. Bathroom is basic but shower has hot water and ok pressure.

I could even partly see New Years fireworks from windows. \n\nApartment concierges were at a ground floor 24 hours. They open the entrance door when you come home. Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos. If you are a vegetarian, I strongly recommend a restaurant “天然齋 Green Veggie” 15min from the apartment."

Everything was clean and tidy. There was lots of space for my family of 4. Especially we enjoyed a big balcony. It's well furnished and equipped but it would be great to add a washing machine. TV has a great channels list in Portuguese and English. The apartment is located in a walking distance to the city centre, metro stations, grocery shops, bakeries and pharmacies. WiFi worked perfectly. The bath has a handle grip, it's perfect for elderly guests and young kids. There is a small lift in a building. Our experience was great and we highly recommend to stay in this apartment."

The host was very easy to work with as far as being able to check in early and check out late, which was very appreciated considering we had two babies with us.  The only downside was that there was no AC. Given, it was my fault for not checking the listing, and although I thought we wouldn't survive a night there, you felt a nice cool breeze when you opened both front and back doors so the AC wasn't needed after all.  (One of the neighbors came to yell at me because one of the babies was crying so I had to keep the door shut) The location was perfect! It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.  There were a couple of issues with roaches, but it's inevitable considering they are condos and not everyone that lives in a complex is clean, although the condo was.  We would stay there again "

Despite there are a lot of people in this Condo Complex (Napili Ridge), we didn't feel the place to be crowdy (as well as elsewhere in Hawaii). While the most interesting activities (IMHO) are in Lahaina, there is just 12-15 min drive. You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).\n____________________________________________________________________\nFacilities/Equipment:\nIt really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.\n____________________________________________________________________\nCleanliness:\nThe place was clean as expected. Host provided to us beach and bathroom towels which was greatly appreciated\n____________________________________________________________________\nOverall\nGreat value-for-money deal for Hawaii travelers who don't want to spend tons of money for vacation. Note that rental car is required in most cases when travelling to Maui."

				"txt": "This studio is really really well located, comfortable and well equipped. I needed to spend a night away from home running around Montreal, and being on the cusp of downtown and the plateau made it easy for me to reach most places I needed to go on foot. Saint Laurent is right around the corner too. Tarek is a friendly and funny guy, and was easy to coordinate with (he actually checked me in personally at 11pm). Oh, and the bed has been replaced by a full one! Definitely would recommend this place to tourists who want a cosy space and central location."

				"txt": "My husband and I had a great time staying at this studio for our daughters graduation. The location is one block away from McGill Downtown campus. The host was very kind to help us find free parking right next to the house upon arrival. The facade of the house looks like a heritage site, very beautiful. The studio has all new facilities, the bathroom is large for a studio and fully renovated. Kitchen is nice, it also had some breakfast items. This place is great for a couple. The only downside is the mattress, not the most comfortable. Otherwise an A+ place and host. Would highly recommend."

				"txt": "We absolutely loved staying at Tarek's charming place which is just how he described it -- a cozy ground floor studio condo that is perfectly situated. We were just steps from the scenic McGill University, a short walk to the vibrants bars & restaurants on St-Laurent Street, and were conveniently able to walk to many other places during our stay. The exterior of the building is beautiful and historical looking while the interior is updated, comfortable, and super clean... all while being very peaceful and serene when we needed a break from sightseeing. \r\n\r\nTarek was a superb host -- he was very kind and communicative with us from the get-go and was flexible to some logistical issues we had. He even gave us \"must-see\" and \"must-eat\" tips and overall made us feel very welcome on our first visit to Montreal. We would definitely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend!"

				"txt": "We had a great experience staying at Tarek's apartment.  It was very clean and spacious for a studio, and the location was fantastic.  We hit quite a bit of unexpected traffic and were about an hour and a half late arriving, and he was extremely accommodating for us.  He helped us find parking, and was available for questions throughout our stay.  Check out was a bit cumbersome because of an unforeseen conflict, but Tarek was very accommodating to make it as easy as possible for us."

				"txt": "My fiancé and I arrived on a Thursday afternoon. Tarek met and welcomed us kindly. He showed us the apartment and even gave us some local restaurants and areas we should visit during our week long stay. He was an excellent host. When I reached out with a couple of questions, he responded even though he was away on vacation. The apartment is perfect for a couple looking to spend quality time together. It's cozy, clean and more than I expected for a studio apartment. I would return here without a question. Thank you Tarek!"

We were three adults staying for three nights, and although the place is set up for one or two adults, Tarek provided us with an inflatable mattress, and things worked out fine.  The place is nice, fully renovated, and very well located, in the heart of McGill Ghetto.  It's very lively with all the students setting up for the school year.  There are a lot of ammenities close by and the location is quite central.  Overall, a very nice stay."

His place is clean, cozy, and very comfortable (the bed is a dream). The apartment is in a superb location: convenient to public parking garages, close to more delicious restaurants and cafes and bars than I can count, only a 20-minute walk from the Museum of Fine Arts, and just a little longer to the Old Port and Notre-Dame Basilica. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!"
